    "   - Advantages: VDZ has been shown to be superior to Adalimumab in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC. It has a good safety profile and is a gut-selective medication, which means it specifically targets the gut and spares other systems.\n",
    "   - Disadvantages: VDZ is associated with an increased risk of new or worsening extraintestinal manifestations. It may not be feasible due to payer preference.\n",
    "2. Infliximab:\n",
    "   - Advantages: IFX is an effective option with a good safety profile. It is the preferred biologic for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with severe UC requiring hospitalization.\n",
    "   - Disadvantages: There is a potential for the colon to act as a “sink” for drugs, which means that drug concentrations should be checked early to ensure proper dosing and to detect immunogenicity early.\n",
