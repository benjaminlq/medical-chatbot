Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

This has \\nincorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical \\nremission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all \\npatients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these \\ndrugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by \\nupadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. \\nranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were \\nanti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of \\nadverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more \\nlikely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo, although etrolizumab 105mg was more \\nlikely to lead to serious adverse events than golimumab 200/100mg, ustekinumab 6mg/kg, \\nvedolizumab 300mg, and infliximab 5mg/kg.

Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Burr et al. \\n \\n7 of 45 \\nINTRODUCTION \\n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \\ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \\nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \\ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \\nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

Vedolizumab: \\n- Pros: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets inflammation in the gut and is less likely to cause systemic side effects. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. \\n\\n- Cons: It may take several weeks to months to work and it does not work in all patients. Injection site reactions and infections are potential side effects. It may not be suitable for patients with a history of malignancy, although the risk is less compared to systemic immunosuppressants.\\n\\n2. Ustekinumab: \\n- Pros: Ustekinumab targets a specific protein (interleukin-12 and -23) involved in inflammation and has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe UC. \\n\\n- Cons: It is administered via injection. Potential side effects include respiratory infections, headache, and fatigue. There is a potential risk of reactivating latent tuberculosis.\\n\\nThe patient\\'s prior history of lymphoma might limit the use of certain biological drugs due to the potential risk of reactivation.

       "    'text': 'Burr et al. \\n \\n7 of 45 \\nINTRODUCTION \\n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \\ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \\nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \\ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \\nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Burr et al. \\n \\n7 of 45 \\nINTRODUCTION \\n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \\ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \\nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \\ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \\nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Burr et al. \\n \\n7 of 45 \\nINTRODUCTION \\n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \\ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \\nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \\ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \\nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

       "  'answer': \"Based on the patient's profile, it seems that this is a patient under maintenance. However, the information provided does not specify the patient's prior response to Infliximab, Anti-TNF agents, or Vedolizumab. It is also not clear if the patient has extraintestinal manifestations or pouchitis. \\n\\nGiven the age of the patient and his history of prostate cancer, it's crucial to select a treatment that will not significantly increase the risk of infection or cancer. \\n\\nHere are two possible choices of biological drugs:\\n\\n1. Drug name: Vedolizumab\\n   Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it primarily works in the gut and is less likely to affect the rest of the body. This could be beneficial for the patient given his age and history of cancer.\\n   Disadvantages: This medication is administered via intravenous infusion, which may be less convenient for the patient. Some potential side effects include headache, joint pain, nausea, or common cold-like symptoms. \\n\\n2. Drug name: Ustekinumab\\n   Advantages: Ustekinumab, which targets a different pathway (interleukin-12 and -23), might be a safer option given the patient's history of cancer. \\n   Disadvantages: Ustekinumab is typically used for patients who have not responded well to or cannot tolerate other medications, so it might not be the first choice. It is also administered through injection. Side effects can include upper respiratory infections, fatigue, and headache.\\n\\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional for the most suitable treatment option.\",\n",

       "    'text': 'Burr et al. \\n \\n7 of 45 \\nINTRODUCTION \\n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \\ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \\nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \\ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \\nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

However, these recommendations need to be considered along with the patient\\'s liver condition and should be discussed thoroughly with a hepatologist.\\n\\n1. Vedolizumab:\\nAdvantages:\\n- Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it mainly works in the gut and less likely to affect other parts of the body. This can be beneficial for a patient with decompensated cirrhosis as it may reduce the risk of extra-intestinal side effects.\\n- It\\'s an effective treatment for moderate to severe UC, and can help achieve and maintain remission.\\n\\nDisadvantages:\\n- The common side effects of Vedolizumab include headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever. More serious side effects can include infections, liver injury, and allergic reactions.\\n- It\\'s administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.\\n\\n2. Ustekinumab:\\nAdvantages:\\n- Ustekinumab has been demonstrated to be effective in treating moderate to severe UC.\\n- It\\'s administered subcutaneously after the initial intravenous dose, which can be more convenient for patients.\\n\\nDisadvantages:\\n- Ustekinumab can increase the risk of infections, including tuberculosis and other serious bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.\\n- It can also cause allergic reactions, and in rare cases, it can affect the heart, liver, or nervous system.\\n\\nPlease note that the decision should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, taking into account the patient\\'s overall health status, liver condition, and potential drug interactions. \\n\\n[{\"drug_name\": \"Vedolizumab\", \"advantages\": \"Gut-selective immunosuppressant, effective in treating moderate to severe UC\", \"disadvantages\": \"Can cause infections, liver injury, allergic reactions, administered intravenously\"}, {\"drug_name\": \"Ustekinumab\", \"advantages\": \"Effective in treating moderate to severe UC, conveniently administered subcutaneously\", \"disadvantages\": \"Increased risk of infections, allergic reactions, rare cases of heart, liver, or nervous system effects\"}]',\n",

       "    'text': 'Burr et al. \\n \\n7 of 45 \\nINTRODUCTION \\n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \\ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \\nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \\ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \\nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

IBD can cause signiﬁcant morbidity and lead\\nto complications such as strictures, ﬁstulas, infections, and\\ncancer.\\nIn\\nchildren,\\nIBD\\ncan\\nalso\\nresult\\nin\\ngrowth\\nimpairment and pubertal delays. IBD is highly heteroge-\\nnous, with severity ranging from mild to severe and\\nsymptoms ranging from mild to debilitating. Delay in IBD\\ndiagnosis, especially in Crohn’s disease, is common and\\nassociated with adverse outcomes. Early diagnosis and\\nprompt institution of treatment are the cornerstones for\\nimproving outcomes and maximizing health. Early diag-\\nnosis requires a low threshold of suspicion and red ﬂags to\\nguide early specialist referral at the primary provider\\nlevel. Although the armamentarium of IBD medications is\\ngrowing, many patients will not respond to treatment, and\\nthe selection of ﬁrst-line therapy is critical. Risk stratiﬁ-\\ncation of disease severity, based on clinical, demographic,\\nand serologic markers, can help guide selection of ﬁrst-line\\ntherapy. Clinical decision support tools, genomics, and\\nother biomarkers of response to therapy and risk of\\nadverse events are the future of personalized medicine.\\nAfter starting appropriate therapy, it is important to\\nconﬁrm remission using objective end points (treat to\\ntarget) with continued control of inﬂammation with\\nadjustment of therapy using surrogate biomarkers (tight\\ncontrol). Lastly, IBD therapy extends far beyond medica-\\ntions, and other aspects of the overall health and wellbeing\\nof the patient are critical.

       "    'text': 'Burr et al. \\n \\n7 of 45 \\nINTRODUCTION \\n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \\ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \\nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \\ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \\nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Burr et al. \\n \\n7 of 45 \\nINTRODUCTION \\n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \\ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \\nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \\ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \\nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

A useful adjunct\\nto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool\\nmarker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/\\ng carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\\ndiagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/\\nor FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to\\n100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional\\nimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.\\nWe refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the\\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn’s and\\nColitis\\nOrganization,\\nand\\nBritish\\nSociety\\nof\\nGastro-\\nenterology.37–40\\nRisk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication\\nat Diagnosis\\nAppropriately\\nrisk-stratifying\\nprognosis\\nin\\npatients\\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection\\nof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-\\ngies.

       "    'text': 'Burr et al. \\n \\n7 of 45 \\nINTRODUCTION \\n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \\ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \\nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \\ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \\nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

       "    'text': 'Burr et al. \\n \\n7 of 45 \\nINTRODUCTION \\n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \\ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \\nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \\ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \\nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \\npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \\n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \\nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \\neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \\nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \\ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \\ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \\nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \\ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \\nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as \\nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β \\nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \\nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \\ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \\nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \\nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \\nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \\ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.'},\n",

Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and\\nendoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We\\nperformed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated\\nodds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative\\nranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of\\nRecommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).\\nRESULTS:\\nIn biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR\\nvs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)\\n(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,\\nustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of\\nclinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;\\n95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)\\nand adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib'},\n",

Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by \\nadjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.\\nResults:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were \\nhighest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance \\namong bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or \\nserious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to \\nAEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during \\nmaintenance.\\nConclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety \\nacross advanced therapies.\\nLay Summary \\nIndirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-\\nsion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across \\nadvanced therapies.\\nKey Words: ulcerative colitis, clinical trials, advanced therapies, network meta-analysis\\nIntroduction\\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-\\nease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized \\nby bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-\\nlaise, weight loss, and fever.
