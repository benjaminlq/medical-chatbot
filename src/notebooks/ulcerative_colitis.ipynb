We aimed \\nto compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with \\nmoderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.\\nMethods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane \\nCentral Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and \\nJuly 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-\\ncontrolled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small \\nmolecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were \\nincluded. Phase 2 RCTs were excluded because of their small sample sizes and inclusion of doses not further explored \\nin phase 3 RCTs. Summary data from intention-to-treat analyses were extracted from included reports by JSL and PAO. \\nThe primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission. A network meta-analysis was done under the frequentist \\nframework, obtaining pairwise odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) \\nwas used to rank the included agents for each outcome. Higher SUCRA scores correlate with better efficacy, whereas \\nlower SUCRA scores correlate with better safety. Maintenance data on efficacy for treat-straight-through and \\nrandomised responder trials are also presented. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021225329.\\nFindings Our search yielded 5904 results, from which 29 studies (four being head-to-head RCTs) fulfilled our inclusion \\ncriteria and were included. Of these, 23 studies assessed induction therapy with either a biologic or small molecule \\ndrug, comprising 10 061 patients with ulcerative colitis. A risk of bias assessment showed a low risk of bias for most \\nof the included studies. Upadacitinib was significantly superior to all other interventions for the induction of clinical \\nremission (infliximab [OR 2·70, 95% CI 1·18–6·20], adalimumab [4·64, 2·47–8·71], golimumab [3·00, 1·32–6·82], \\nvedolizumab [3·56, 1·84–6·91], ustekinumab [2·92, 1·31–6·51], etrolizumab [4·91, 2·59–9·31], tofacitinib [2·84, \\n1·28–6·31], filgotinib 100 mg [6·15, 2·98–12·72], filgotinib 200 mg [4·49, 2·18–9·24], and ozanimod (2·70, \\n1·18–6·20), and ranked highest for the induction of clinical remission (SUCRA 0·996). No differences between active \\ninterventions were observed when assessing adverse events and serious adverse events. Vedolizumab ranked lowest \\nfor both adverse events (SUCRA 0·184) and serious adverse events (0·139), whereas upadacitinib ranked highest for \\nadverse events (0·843) and ozanimod ranked highest for serious adverse events (0·831).\\nInterpretation Upadacitinib was the best performing agent for the induction of clinical remission (the primary \\noutcome) but the worst performing agent in terms of adverse events in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative \\ncolitis.

Biologics with other targets were later approved \\nfor the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, \\nnamely vedolizumab and, more recently, usteki numab. \\nHowever, \\ntreatment \\nwith \\nbiologics \\nhas \\nseveral \\nlimit ations, including limited efficacy, primary non-\\nresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, \\n', metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/QUAN/Desktop/medical-chatbot/data/document_store/uc/1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf', 'file_path': '/mnt/c/Users/QUAN/Desktop/medical-chatbot/data/document_store/uc/1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf', 'page': 0, 'total_pages': 10, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis', 'author': 'Juan S Lasa MD', 'subject': 'The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology, 7 (2022) 161-170. doi:10.1016/S2468-1253(21)00377-0', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Elsevier', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 6.0 for Windows', 'creationDate': \"D:20211223225432+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20220108175830+05'30'\", 'trapped': '', 'modal': 'text'}),\n",

For comparative \\nsafety, a network meta-analysis of all trials of induction \\ntherapy was done.\\nDirect comparisons were done by use of RevMan software \\n(version 5.4). Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated \\nby I² tests, with values greater than 50% suggesting \\nsubstantial heterogeneity. A random-effects model was \\nused to give a more conserv ative estimate of the effect of \\nindividual therapies, allowing for any heterogeneity among \\nstudies. Outcome measures were described as odds \\nratios (ORs), with their corres ponding 95% CIs. Possible \\npublication bias was assessed with the Egger test. We then \\nconducted a network meta-analysis using the multi variate \\nfrequentist approach described by Rücker and Schwarzer, \\nusing R software, version 4.0.3.17 We calculated the relative \\nranking of agents for each outcome (ie, clinical remission, \\nendoscopic improvement, adverse events, and serious \\nadverse events) as their surface under the cumulative \\nranking (SUCRA), which represents the percentage of \\nefficacy or safety achieved by an agent compared with an \\nimaginary agent that is always the best without uncertainty. \\nA higher SUCRA score means a higher ranking for efficacy \\noutcomes.

As observed for clinical remission, our network \\nmeta-analysis found that both tofacitinib and ustekinumab \\nwere significantly superior to both vedolizumab and \\nadalimumab for the induction of endoscopic improvement \\n(moderate confidence; appendix p 27). Tofacitinib \\n(SUCRA 0·936) and ustekinumab (0·851) ranked highest \\nfor the induction of endoscopic improvement in biologic-\\nexposed patients (appendix p 26).\\nOverall, seven studies reported rates of histo logical \\nremission (ie, VARSITY, UNIFI, True North, SELECTION, \\nVISIBLE 1, LAUREL, and HICKORY) that could be \\ncompared. Results of our post-hoc, direct, pairwise meta-\\nanalysis for histological remission are shown in the \\nappendix (p 28).\\nDiscussion \\nWe reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs \\nof biologics and small molecule drugs (approved or in a \\nlate stage of development) for induction and maintenance \\ntreatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative \\ncolitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics, \\nexcept filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than \\nplacebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and \\nendoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study \\nwas that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of \\nclinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and \\nwas notably superior for these outcomes to all other \\ninterventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab \\nranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety, \\nvedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in \\nterms of adverse events and serious adverse events, as \\npreviously \\nobserved \\nby \\nSingh \\nand \\ncolleagues.13 \\nUpadacitinib had the highest SUCRA for all adverse \\nevents, showing that its remarkable efficacy might come \\nat a cost of more adverse events. Results regarding \\nfilgotinib’s safety were puzzling: it had the second lowest \\nSUCRA for all adverse events, but ranked third highest \\nfor serious adverse events among active interventions. \\nRepresenting another novel finding of this study, \\ntofacitinib \\nand \\ninfliximab \\nwere \\nranked \\nhighest \\nfor the maintenance of steroid-free remission in \\nrandomised \\nresponders \\nand \\ntreat-straight-through \\nstudies, respectively.\\nOur study included RCTs evaluating infliximab, \\nadalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, \\netrolizumab, \\ntofacitinib, \\nfilgotinib, \\nozanimod, \\nand \\nupadacitinib. Evidence regarding the induction of clinical \\nremission, endoscopic improvement, and safety outcomes \\nfrom 29 studies was synthesised, and indirect comparisons \\nbetween therapies were made. Since the most recent \\nsystematic review was published,13 a large amount of new \\ndata involving novel compounds has become available. \\nThis sheer increase in the number of therapeutic options \\nfor ulcerative colitis makes frequent updates of indirect \\ncomparisons useful in the clinical setting.\\nThe inflammatory bowel disease pipeline has shifted in \\nthe past 5 years towards small molecule drugs, in an \\neffort \\nto \\novercome \\nthe \\nintrinsic \\nlimitations \\nof \\nbiological \\ntreatment: \\nmoderate \\nefficacy, \\nloss \\nof \\nresponse, immunogenicity, and parenteral adminis-\\ntration. However, available data from RCTs of small \\nmolecule drugs show that they induce similar rates of \\nclinical remission and endoscopic improvement to \\nbiologics.42 Moreover, safety concerns have arisen \\nsurrounding the use of tofacitinib, especially regarding \\nthe potential risk of venous thromboembolism and \\nherpes zoster infection. One meta-analysis found an \\nincreased risk of herpes zoster infection with the use of \\nJAK inhibitors in patients with immune-mediated \\ninflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel \\ndisease.43 This adverse event could be easily prevented by \\nappropriate vaccination. The same meta-analysis did not \\nfind an increased risk of venous thromboembolism with \\nthe use of JAK inhibitors, although, until further evidence \\nbecomes available, caution is advised when considering \\nJAK inhibitors as treatment options, especially in patients \\nwith known risk factors for thrombosis. Selective JAK-1 \\ninhibitors, such as upadacitinib and filgotinib, were \\ndeveloped to improve the risk–benefit profile of this \\ntherapeutic class.44 However, in our study, upadacitinib \\nwas ranked highest for all adverse events and filgotinib \\nwas ranked third highest among active interventions (ie, \\nnot including placebo) for serious adverse events, \\nopposing this notion.\\nRepresenting a surprising finding of this study, \\nozanimod ranked highest for the occurrence of serious \\nadverse events. Ozanimod is a selective sphingosine \\n1-phosphate modulator approved for the treatment of \\nmultiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis in the USA. Another \\nmeta-analysis showed that sphingosine 1-phosphate \\nmodulators are associated with an increased risk of herpes \\nzoster infection and transient cardiovascular events.45\\nOur study has several limitations besides the usual \\nlimitations of network meta-analyses. First, data from \\nsome clinical trials with newer small molecule drugs were \\nextracted from conference abstracts, and the full data could \\nnot be completely analysed. Notably, we could only analyse \\noutcomes for the overall population as the main analysis, \\nand not according to previous exposure to biologics. We \\ndid do an exploratory analysis according to previous \\nbiologic exposure, but data for upadacitinib could not be \\nincluded. Second, no phase 3 RCTs with etrasimod or \\nTD-1473 were found; results from phase 3 clinical trials \\ntesting novel small molecule drugs (eg, etrasimod) in \\npatients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis are \\nexpected soon, which will warrant further updates \\nof this analysis. Additionally, several newer biologics, \\nespecially anti-IL-23 drugs (ie, risankizumab, mirikizumab, \\nguselkumab, and brazikumab), are also expected to yield \\npositive results in phase 3 clinical trials, so these data \\nshould also be considered in the future to determine \\ntheir position in treatment algorithms.

IBD is highly heteroge-\\nnous, with severity ranging from mild to severe and\\nsymptoms ranging from mild to debilitating. Delay in IBD\\ndiagnosis, especially in Crohn’s disease, is common and\\nassociated with adverse outcomes. Early diagnosis and\\nprompt institution of treatment are the cornerstones for\\nimproving outcomes and maximizing health. Early diag-\\nnosis requires a low threshold of suspicion and red ﬂags to\\nguide early specialist referral at the primary provider\\nlevel. Although the armamentarium of IBD medications is\\ngrowing, many patients will not respond to treatment, and\\nthe selection of ﬁrst-line therapy is critical. Risk stratiﬁ-\\ncation of disease severity, based on clinical, demographic,\\nand serologic markers, can help guide selection of ﬁrst-line\\ntherapy. Clinical decision support tools, genomics, and\\nother biomarkers of response to therapy and risk of\\nadverse events are the future of personalized medicine.\\nAfter starting appropriate therapy, it is important to\\nconﬁrm remission using objective end points (treat to\\ntarget) with continued control of inﬂammation with\\nadjustment of therapy using surrogate biomarkers (tight\\ncontrol).

In children, persistent inﬂamma-\\ntion\\nis\\nassociated\\nwith\\ngrowth\\nimpairment,\\nrisking\\npermanent loss of height.18 Similar to other chronic dis-\\neases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-\\ntive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be\\nmeasured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.19\\nLimited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,\\nSymptoms, and Complications\\nThe concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and\\nsymptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a\\npopulation-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients\\nwere found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the\\ntime of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-\\nmation may precede formal diagnosis.22 The STRIDE\\n(Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inﬂammatory Bowel Dis-\\nease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant to\\ntarget endoscopic healing, minimize disability, and restore\\nquality of life and adequate growth in children, in addition\\nto control of symptoms.23 Therefore, rather than a gradual\\n“step-up” approach, in which treatment adjustment is based\\non the severity of symptoms, the recommended treat-to-\\ntarget approach aims to achieve endoscopic healing and\\ncontrol of inﬂammation and involves early, aggressive\\ntreatment in appropriate patients.23\\nDelay in Diagnosis Leads to Adverse Outcomes\\nDelay in diagnosis is more common in CD than UC\\n(median delay, 7.6 months; interquartile range [IQR], 3.1–\\n15.0 months and 3.3 months; IQR, 1.9–7.3 months, respec-\\ntively; P < .001).24 Data from the Swiss IBD cohort\\ndemonstrate that CD diagnosis can be delayed in pediatric\\nand adult patients by 3 months (IQR, 1–9 months) and 6\\nmonths (IQR, 1–24 months), respectively. Adults were more\\nlikely to present with strictures (P < .001) and require\\nbowel surgery (P < .001). Furthermore, the duration of\\ndiagnostic delay has been associated with complications\\nsuch as strictures and internal ﬁstulae.25 In a study, of adult\\nCD patients in France, delay in diagnosis longer than 13\\nmonths was associated with higher risk of a major surgery\\n(P ¼ .05).26\\nEvidence of Disease Activity Before Diagnosis\\nThere is a signiﬁcant increase in gastrointestinal symp-\\ntoms before IBD diagnosis (9.6% and 10.4% 5 years before\\nCD and UC diagnosis, respectively, compared with 5.8% of\\ncontrols).27 In addition, patients who were diagnosed with\\nirritable bowel syndrome or depression were less likely to\\nreceive timely specialist referral (irritable bowel syndrome:\\nhazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 0.60–\\n0.99, depression: HR, 0.77, 95% CI, 0.60–0.98), suggesting\\nthat delays in IBD diagnosis may be related to focusing on\\ncomorbid or inaccurate diagnoses.27 In a population-based\\nstudy using data from the Danish registry, Vadstrup\\net al28 found a signiﬁcant increase in costs associated with\\nhealth care services, prescription medicine, home care ser-\\nvices, and labor productivity loss in the 10 years before IBD\\ndiagnosis.\\nGrowth Impairment and Pubertal Delays in\\nChildren\\nIBD and ongoing inﬂammation can lead to impairment of\\ngrowth and pubertal development to children. Impaired\\nlinear growth may be the only presenting symptom of IBD\\nin pediatric patients.29,30 Growth impairment is multifacto-\\nrial in nature, representing the summation of nutritional\\ndeﬁciencies, altered eating habits, inﬂammatory cytokines,\\nand corticosteroid use. Marked growth impairment at\\ndiagnosis, deﬁned as a height z-score < –2.5, is a poor\\nprognostic sign.31 Furthermore, IBD patients exhibit “catch\\nup” growth beyond the typically expected age for growth\\nplate closure (median additional years to reach adult height:\\nmale patients with CD, 1.9 years and male patients with UC,\\n2.5 years; female patients with CD: 2.6 years and female\\npatients with UC, 2.8 years), suggesting that achieving\\nremission even after reaching adolescence may allow for\\nmaximal growth potential.18\\nEarly Management Can Alter Disease Course and\\nPrevent Complications\\nData have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD\\ncomplications are mitigated by early treatment and remis-\\nsion. In the long-term follow-up data from the CALM trial,\\npatients with early CD who achieved deep remission,\\ncompared to those who did not, had a signiﬁcantly lower\\nrisk of new ﬁstulas, abscesses, hospitalization, or surgery for\\nCD (adjusted HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07–0.31) during a median\\n3 years’ follow-up.32 Other CD studies have similarly\\ndemonstrated\\nthat\\nearly\\ntreatment\\nis\\nindependently\\n48\\nAgrawal et al\\nGastroenterology Vol. 161, No. 1\\nREVIEWS AND\\nPERSPECTIVES\\n', metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/QUAN/Desktop/medical-chatbot/data/document_store/uc/agrawal.pdf', 'file_path': '/mnt/c/Users/QUAN/Desktop/medical-chatbot/data/document_store/uc/agrawal.pdf', 'page': 1, 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': \"Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists\", 'author': 'Manasi Agrawal', 'subject': 'Gastroenterology, 161 (2021) 47-65. doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2021.04.063', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Elsevier', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20210619033246+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20210619033336+05'30'\", 'trapped': '', 'modal': 'text'}),\n",

These can\\nmake the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary\\ncare level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index\\nconsisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage\\nand identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely\\nmanner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct\\nto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool\\nmarker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/\\ng carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\\ndiagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/\\nor FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to\\n100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional\\nimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.\\nWe refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the\\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn’s and\\nColitis\\nOrganization,\\nand\\nBritish\\nSociety\\nof\\nGastro-\\nenterology.37–40\\nRisk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication\\nat Diagnosis\\nAppropriately\\nrisk-stratifying\\nprognosis\\nin\\npatients\\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection\\nof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-\\ngies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial\\npresentation can vary widely from limited and mild to\\nextensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features\\nare associated with a more aggressive disease course with\\nhigher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk\\npatients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-\\nmodifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-\\nsive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the\\nshort- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.\\nTherefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives\\nis key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the\\ninformed patient.\\nIt is important to differentiate between disease activity\\nand severity. Although the former refers to the burden of\\ninﬂammation at any given point in time, the latter takes into\\naccount the disease phenotype and course, and is helpful in\\ndetermining\\nprognosis\\nand\\npredicting\\ncomplications\\n(Figure 1). For example, a patient with low disease activity\\n(little to no symptoms and low inﬂammatory markers) may\\nactually have high severity (due to disease history or\\nbehavior) increasing the risk for disease progression, and\\nshould be managed more proactively and aggressively. We\\nwill review predictors of IBD severity and activity.\\nAge of Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis\\nNumerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis\\nis tied to adverse outcomes in both CD and UC.41 In CD,\\nbeing diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associated\\nwith an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–\\n3.6) of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, including\\nhigher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,\\nand disease recurrence.42,43 In UC, younger age at diagnosis\\nis linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-\\nrectal cancer.44,45 There are conﬂicting data on the disease\\ncourse in the very-early-onset IBD population of patients\\ndiagnosed before age 6 years, with studies reporting both\\nsimilar\\nand\\nworse\\noutcomes\\nin\\nvery-early-onset\\nIBD\\ncompared to the general pediatric population.46 Similar to\\nthe youngest patients with IBD, elderly-onset IBD (diag-\\nnosed at 60–65 years of age) has conﬂicting evidence on\\nprognosis, with 1 study reporting fewer hospitalizations and\\nless frequent requirement of immunosuppression in pa-\\ntients diagnosed after age 60 years,47 and a meta-analysis\\nsuggested\\nthat,\\nalthough\\nelderly\\nIBD\\npresents\\nless\\ncommonly with complications, there are similar or higher\\nrates of surgery compared to a nonelderly population.48 It is\\nbeing increasingly recognized that frailty, rather than\\nchronologic age, may be the driver of adverse outcomes in\\nthis group.49,50\\nOther Demographic Variables\\nThere are signiﬁcant differences in IBD phenotype\\nand outcomes based on race and ethnicity, likely due to\\na multitude of factors, both social and biologic. Emer-\\ngency department use, hospitalization, complicated dis-\\nease\\ncourse,\\nand\\nIBD-related\\ndisability\\nare\\nmore\\ncommon in minority and lower socioeconomic status\\ngroups.51,52 In a study of 770 patients with IBD, South\\nAsian immigrants living in the United Kingdom were\\nmore\\nlikely\\nto\\nhave\\nextensive\\nUC\\nand\\ncolonic\\nCD\\ncompared with their native counterparts,53 which might\\nbe related, in part, to limited access to care.54 Genes\\nimplicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared\\nwith White patients with IBD.55 Being aware of the\\nhigher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in\\nthese vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-\\ntoring to limit adverse outcomes.\\nThere are increasing data on sex-based differences in\\nIBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences\\nin pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-\\nintestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be\\nmore common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–\\n2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-\\nBank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of\\nnearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have\\nEIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared\\nwith boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-\\nlike growth factor-1 level in boys.58\\nJuly 2021\\nManagement of early IBD\\n49\\nREVIEWS AND\\nPERSPECTIVES\\n', metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/QUAN/Desktop/medical-chatbot/data/document_store/uc/agrawal.pdf', 'file_path': '/mnt/c/Users/QUAN/Desktop/medical-chatbot/data/document_store/uc/agrawal.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': \"Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists\", 'author': 'Manasi Agrawal', 'subject': 'Gastroenterology, 161 (2021) 47-65. doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2021.04.063', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Elsevier', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20210619033246+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20210619033336+05'30'\", 'trapped': '', 'modal': 'text'}),\n",

These include perinuclear antineutrophil\\nantibody and several antimicrobial antibodies, notably anti-\\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae antibody, antibody to Escherichia\\ncoli outer-membrane porin C, and antibody to ﬂagellin\\n(CBir1). In the Pediatric RISK Stratiﬁcation study, a large\\nprospective study of CD, patients positive for 2 or more\\nserologic markers (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody,\\nouter-membrane porin C, and/or CBir1) progressed to a\\npenetrating or stricturing complication more quickly than\\nthose with only 1 serologic marker, and those receiving anti-\\nTNF in this cohort had a reduced likelihood of progression\\nto penetrating complications, indicating a window to change\\ndisease complication.41 Another autoantibody of interest is\\nthat to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor,\\nof which high expression has been associated with stric-\\nturing and penetrating behavior in adult and pediatric\\nCD.71,72\\nFecal Calprotectin\\nStool markers of inﬂammation, of which FC is the\\nmost widely used, are more speciﬁc for bowel inﬂam-\\nmation compared to serum markers.73 FC is limited by\\npatients’ reticence to collect stool and lack of speciﬁcity\\nfor IBD, but it remains an important tool for stratifying\\nnewly diagnosed patients with IBD for risk of progres-\\nsion and response to ﬁrst therapy.

If the result is\\nunexpectedly high, it is appropriate to repeat based on\\nclinical judgment, as there can be variability among\\nmeasurements within the same individual even on the\\nsame day.75 Lastly, there is variability between assays\\nand it is important to use assay-speciﬁc cutoff values\\nuntil there is standardization.76\\nFC has been shown to accurately discriminate between\\nendoscopic disease severity in both UC73 and CD.77 Kennedy\\net al78 demonstrated that an elevated FC (>250 mg/g) at\\nindex visit for CD was associated with increased rates of\\ndisease\\nprogression.\\nMore\\nrecently,\\nthe\\nsame\\ngroup\\nreported that achieving an FC <250 mg/g within 12 months\\nof diagnosis was associated with a reduction in the risk of\\ndisease progression.79\\nGenetic Risk Predictors\\nThere are more than 200 identiﬁed risk loci for IBD.55,80\\nIBD susceptibility mutations in nucleotide-binding oligo-\\nmerization domain 2 (NOD2), which is involved in the host–\\nmicrobe immune response, were the ﬁrst identiﬁed and\\nconfer the greatest risk for IBD.81,82 In a large genotype–\\nphenotype study of CD, NOD2 was noted to be strongly\\ntied to ileal disease location and younger age at diagnosis\\nand, when accounting for ileal disease location, an associa-\\ntion with stricturing disease no longer remained.83\\nPolygenic risk scores (a summation of risk alleles\\nweighted by effect size derived from genome-wide associ-\\nation studies) have been studied, but the methods used to\\ncreate the scores vary widely. Within the RISK cohort,\\nneither a polygenic risk score nor NOD2 were associated\\nwith stricturing or ﬁstulizing behavior.41 As more expansive,\\ngenome-wide polygenic risk scores improve and evolve with\\nthe help of more sophisticated techniques, they continue to\\nwarrant further exploration as a prognostic test.84\\nRisk Prediction Tools\\nRisk prediction models are being incorporated consis-\\ntently across diseases toward risk stratiﬁcation and shared\\ndecision-making at the individual level. For CD patients,\\nSiegel et al85 developed and validated a web-based predic-\\ntion tool (PROSPECT) to individualize risk of complications\\nusing clinical, serologic, and genetic markers. Variables in\\nthe prediction tool included the presence of small bowel\\ndisease (HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.05–4.29), left colonic disease\\n(HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.49–1.09), perianal disease (HR, 4.12;\\n95% CI, 1.01–16.88), anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody\\n(HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.16–1.58), anti-CBir1 (HR, 1.29; 95% CI,\\n1.07–1.55), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (HR, 0.77;\\n95% CI, 0.62–0.95), and the NOD2 frameshift mutation/\\nSNP13 (HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.33–3.40), with a predictive ac-\\ncuracy of 73% and 75% in adults and children, respectively.\\nThis is expected to be available for clinical use in early 2021.\\nClinical risk features (disease severity), as well as degree\\nof intestinal inﬂammation (disease activity), can be very\\nuseful to stratify outcomes of IBD and guide personalized\\ntherapy.

It is\\nassociated with improved outcomes, a decrease in loss of\\nTNFi response, and fewer long-term complications.90,91 The\\nmechanism of action may be due to decrease in immuno-\\ngenicity and impact on drug level. Similar effects have not\\nbeen seen with adding IMM to UST of VDZ therapy, possibly\\ndue to a lower role of immunogenicity in drug meta-\\nbolism.92 For patients with perianal CD, a multidisciplinary\\napproach with early referral to a colorectal surgeon is key to\\nimproved outcomes.93\\nIleocolic resection as a ﬁrst-line therapy.

In the VARSITY trial, the only\\nhead-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-\\nrior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;\\nP ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P\\n< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST\\nmay not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-\\nularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107\\nThiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after\\nweighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC\\nrequiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for\\ninduction and maintenance of remission, with or without\\nIMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-\\nciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes\\ncompared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a\\nmonotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential\\nfor the colon to act as a “sink” for drugs, we advocate for\\nchecking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing\\nand detecting immunogenicity early along with other\\npharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no\\nclear beneﬁt of concomitant mesalamine with biologic\\ntherapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to\\nbiologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe\\nUC\\nwhere\\nTNFi,\\ncyclosporine,\\nor\\nsubtotal\\ncolectomy\\nfollowed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good\\ninitial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe\\nUC is beyond the scope of this article.\\nTaking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into\\nConsideration\\nEIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30%–40% of\\npatients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs\\nbefore IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration\\nacross specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-\\ngists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to\\nprompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to\\nallow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,\\nbut also to allow for consideration of both in the selection of\\ntherapy, dose, and chronicity of treatment. For example, VDZ,\\nwhich is gut-selective, is associated with an increased risk of\\nde novo or worsening EIM.114,115 In patients with signiﬁcant\\nsymptoms of EIM, one should weigh the potential beneﬁt of\\nVDZ against another therapy, such as TNFi, that might more\\nbroadly target gut and systemic inﬂammation.116\\nPredictors of Response to Inﬂammatory Bowel\\nDisease Therapy\\nThe number of therapeutic agents in the IBD arma-\\nmentarium are numbered, and each agent has limited\\nefﬁcacy. In addition, the ﬁrst biologic, regardless of choice,\\nhas the highest probability of success. For all of these rea-\\nsons, it is important to be thoughtful in selecting the initial\\ntherapy. Clinical decision support tools (CDSTs) and pre-\\ndiction models are being developed to help with this.\\nSmoking has been associated with lower response to\\nTNFi, and among responders, shorter response duration.117\\nUsing ACT1 and ACT2 trial data, Vande Casteele et al118\\ndeveloped a CDST incorporating IFX clearance, stool fre-\\nquency, rectal bleeding scores, white blood cell count, and\\nbody weight to predict endoscopic healing in UC at different\\ntime points, with accuracy in the range of 80% or higher.\\nExternal validation models, however, had lower predictive\\nvalue, with an area under of the curve of 0.67 (95% CI,\\n0.61–0.74). Similar CDSTs have been developed to predict\\nresponse to CD and UC with VDZ.119,120 Such tools require\\nclinical variables that are widely available, have no associ-\\nated costs, and are feasible to incorporate in discussions\\nwith the patient. Ultimately, biomarkers that are speciﬁc to\\nunderlying mechanisms of action may be most accurate in\\nhelping select the right therapy for the patient. Although\\nthese CDSTs and predictors show promise, none have been\\nprospectively validated and are not yet ready for full\\nincorporation into routine clinical care.\\nPredictors of Adverse Events With Inﬂammatory\\nBowel Disease Therapy\\nGenetic heterogeneity pertaining to drug metabolism\\nimpacts adverse events and can be leveraged to guide\\ntherapy. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), the ﬁrst\\nidentiﬁed variant impacting IBD therapy, is involved in\\nthiopurine metabolism with decreased activity resulting in\\nsevere leukopenia. Thiopurines should be avoided or the\\ndose lowered based on genotype and the associated TPMT\\nactivity.121 Nudix hydrolase (NUDT15) mutations have been\\nimplicated in leukopenia risk with thiopurine in European\\nand Asian populations.122,123 A combination of TPMT and\\nNUDT15 mutations accounts for nearly 50% of cases with\\nsevere thiopurine-induced leukopenia.123 Testing for TPMT\\ngenotype or enzyme level and NUDT15 genotype before\\ninitiating thiopurine therapy is recommended. In addition,\\npolymorphism in the HLA class II region (rs2647087) is\\nassociated with pancreatitis risk in thiopurine-treated in-\\ndividuals, 9% risk in heterozygotes and 17% risk in\\nhomozygotes.124\\nBeyond IMMs, there is promise in using genetic variants\\nto further aid in identiﬁcation of adverse events with bio-\\nlogic therapies.

A serologic panel of 13 protein markers, the Endo-\\nscopic Healing Index (Monitr, Prometheus Biosciences,\\nSan Diego, CA), validated in CD to distinguish endoscopic\\nactivity, is comparable to FC and likely superior to CRP\\nalone.130 Another modality of interest is point-of-care in-\\ntestinal ultrasound, which allows for noninvasive and\\ninexpensive evaluation of variables correlated with dis-\\nease activity (bowel wall thickness, Doppler signal, and\\nwall layer stratiﬁcation) and has been used to measure\\ninitial response to therapy,131 as well as ongoing assess-\\nment of disease activity in both CD and UC.132,133 MRI is a\\nreasonable alternative monitoring modality, with 2 small\\nstudies\\nreporting\\nthe\\nability\\nof\\nMRI\\nto\\naccurately\\ndiscriminate mucosal healing based on cut points of Ma-\\nRIA and Nancy scores.134,135\\nWe\\nrecommend\\nidentifying\\nan\\nappropriate\\ntarget,\\ndepending on disease characteristics, availability of re-\\nsources and patient preference, and treating to achieve\\nnormalization\\nof\\nthe\\ntarget,\\nfollowed\\nby\\nperiodic\\nreassessment.\\nAchieving the Target: Therapy Optimization and\\nDrug Monitoring\\nWhatever the choice of initial therapy, it is important to\\noptimize it to achieve maximal beneﬁt to the patient as well\\nas to fully exploit its efﬁcacy in the setting of expanding, but\\nstill limited, therapeutic choices. This optimization entails\\ndose and interval adjustments or the addition of a medica-\\ntion to use in combination and is often based on therapeutic\\ndrug monitoring (TDM). This can be as simple as dose\\nescalation of mesalamine (deﬁned as increasing dose by 2.4\\ng/day), which, even in clinically quiescent patients, led to\\nreduction of calprotectin levels to <100 mg/g and was tied\\nto longer time to relapse.136\\nTDM is typically used to optimize both thiopurines and\\nbiologics (Table 1). With thiopurines, monitoring metabo-\\nlites has long been accepted.137 AGA guidelines currently\\nrecommend the use of TDM to achieve target drug con-\\ncentrations and assess for presence of high-level neutral-\\nizing anti-drug antibodies at time of treatment failure for\\nTNFi therapies.121 However, controversy remains over the\\nutility of proactive TDM with TNFi agents.138 Proactive TDM\\nfor biologics may also offer a cost beneﬁt compared to\\nempirical adjustments of therapy.139 A further nuance to\\nTDM with biologics is the choice of target concentration.\\nBoth the AGA121 and the BRIDGe (Building Research in IBD\\nGlobally) Group have suggested target concentrations based\\non the currently available literature; BRIDGe offers a web-\\nbased tool to assist in choosing target drug concentrations\\nbased on patient characteristics (Table 1).140,141 If these\\ntargets are not achieved, escalation of dose, shortening of\\ninterval, and/or adding an immunomodulator, in the case of\\nTNFi, are recommended, with subsequent reassessment of\\ndrug concentration until targets are reached.\\nMaintaining the Target: Tight Control\\nOnce achieving target goals, patients should continue to\\nbe monitored serially every 3–6 months with clinical visit\\nand noninvasive inﬂammatory markers (FC and CRP).\\nProspective studies show that FC can increase and predict\\nrelapse 3–4 months before clinical symptoms in both UC\\nand CD, making it a viable biomarker for monitoring, even\\nin the quiescent state.142 In the post-hoc analysis of the\\nTAILORIX (Drug Concentration Versus Symptom-Driven\\nDose Adaptation of IFX in Patients With Active CD) study,\\nFC was highly predictive of mucosal healing in their cohort\\nafter week 2, and, in the setting of a persistently abnormal\\nFC, they recommended assessing a drug concentration at\\nthe same time to determine a possible pharmacokinetic\\ncause of failure to achieve endoscopic and histologic\\nremission.143 Future studies will determine the role of the\\nEndoscopic Healing Index as a biomarker to monitor tight\\ncontrol.\\n360-Degree Inﬂammatory Bowel\\nDisease Care\\nBeyond prognostication and medical and surgical man-\\nagement, outcomes in IBD are improved when there is a\\n56\\nAgrawal et al\\nGastroenterology Vol. 161, No. 1\\nREVIEWS AND\\nPERSPECTIVES\\n', metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/QUAN/Desktop/medical-chatbot/data/document_store/uc/agrawal.pdf', 'file_path': '/mnt/c/Users/QUAN/Desktop/medical-chatbot/data/document_store/uc/agrawal.pdf', 'page': 9, 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': \"Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists\", 'author': 'Manasi Agrawal', 'subject': 'Gastroenterology, 161 (2021) 47-65. doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2021.04.063', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Elsevier', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20210619033246+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20210619033336+05'30'\", 'trapped': '', 'modal': 'text'}),\n",

Personalized IBD\\ncare is fast-evolving, and sophisticated prediction models\\nincorporating multi-omic platforms are likely to be the\\nfuture of IBD therapeutics.\\nSupplementary Material\\nNote: To access the supplementary material accompanying\\nthis article, visit the online version of Gastroenterology at\\nwww.gastrojournal.org, and at http://dxdoi.org/10.1053/\\nj.gastro.2021.04.063.\\nReferences\\n1.

As a result of this\\nvast landscape of treatment, positioning advanced therapies (according to clinical situation, efﬁcacy and safety) is\\nof paramount importance to providing personalized, appropriate IBD treatment.\\nIn this publication the recent available literature is summarized for practical integration into clinical practice\\nincluding comparative efﬁcacy data, patient and disease demographics. We refer to recent publications and expert\\nopinion in order to facilitate the decision making process of positioning biologicals IBD treatment.\\n1. Introduction\\nBiological therapies have revolutionized the management of inﬂam-\\nmatory bowel diseases (IBD). Monoclonal antibodies against tumor ne-\\ncrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) have been the cornerstone of IBD therapy\\nsince the start of the century. In 1998, inﬂiximab was the ﬁrst biological\\nmedication approved for the use of Crohn's disease (CD), followed by\\nadalimumab. Numerous studies have demonstrated their efﬁcacy and\\ncost effectiveness for the induction and maintenance of remission in CD\\n(Townsend et al., 2020) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (Colombel et al.,\\n2007; Pantavou et al., 2019). Golimumab for UC (Sandborn et al., 2014)\\nand Certolizumab pegol for CD (Schreiber et al., 2010; Yamazaki et al.,\\n2019) are other anti-TNF inhibitors that are currently available. After\\nover 20 years of experience of prescribing anti-TNF agents, their safety\\nproﬁle has been well described and dose optimization has been incor-\\nporated into daily clinical practice although proactive monitoring re-\\nmains a question of debate (Argollo et al., 2020).\\nMore recently, two additional biologicals, with different mechanisms\\nof action, have complemented the IBD armamentarium. The ﬁrst is\\nvedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the homing receptor\\nα4β7 integrin complex, blocking the interaction of the surface homing\\nmolecules of activated immune cells with the endothelium to reduce\\ndiapedesis. The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonal\\nantibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These\\nnew agents have now proved their efﬁcacy not only against placebo but\\nalso in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in speciﬁc indications\\n(Sands et al., 2019, 2021; Irving et al., 2021). Consequently, they possess\\na comfortable market position compared to the historical anti-TNF\\nagents, when not surpassing them for certain targeted groups of pa-\\ntients. However, striking efﬁcacy differences have not been shown to\\nsupport their superiority and anti-TNF agents remain the most appro-\\npriate medications in presence of most concomitant extraintestinal\\nmanifestations or in ﬁstulizing CD (Juillerat et al., 2020; Papamichael\\net al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021). Additionally, other biologicals such as\\netrolizumab (Danese et al., 2021; Peyrin-Biroulet et al., 2021; Rubin\\net al., 2021) (monoclonal antibody against the B7 subunit of integrins\\nα4β7 and αЕβ7) as well as guselkumab, mirikizumab and risankizumab,\\nother monoclonal antibodies which binds to p19 subunit of interleukin\\n23 (Sandborn et al., 2020; Schett et al., 2021) are emerging in the market.\\nAs treatment choices expand with the introduction of newer bi-\\nologicals with proven efﬁcacy against placebo decision making pathways\\nbecome necessary in order to differentiate between the biologicals. The\\naim of this publication is to provide an evidence based guidance which\\naids the decision making process in positioning biologicals according to\\nthe efﬁcacy, patient characteristics, safety proﬁle and speciﬁc in-\\ndications. The positioning of the novel small molecules in the treatment\\nof IBD is beyond the scope of this article.\\n* Corresponding author.

              "  Document(page_content=\"2. Comparative efﬁcacy of available biological agents\\nThe biological agents available for IBD treatment and their individual\\ncharacteristics are summarized in Table 1.\\n2.1. Head to head trials\\nDirect comparison of drugs are uncommon in the IBD literature.\\nRandomized, double blinded, double dummy, head to head comparative\\ntrials in IBD provide evidence comparing two drugs and overcome the\\nproblem of bias that is often present in observational studies. In the IBD\\nﬁeld, the ﬁrst head to head published was the VARSITY trial (Sands et al.,\\n2019). This trial, conducted over 1 year, compared 383 UC patients\\ntreated with vedolizumab to 386 UC patients treated with adalimumab.\\nThe primary outcome was reached. At week 52 the clinical remission rate\\n(31.3% vs. 22.5%; P ¼ 0.006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs.\\n27.7%; P < 0.001) was signiﬁcantly higher with vedolizumab compared\\nto adalimumab. There were no striking safety differences between the\\ntwo drugs over the 1-year period.\\nThe ﬁrst head to head in Crohn's disease was recently presented at\\nDigestive Disease Week (DDW) 2021(Sands et al., 2021) and European\\nCrohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) congress 2021(Irving et al.,\\n2021). The SEAVUE study compared ustekinumab with adalimumab in\\n386 bio-naïve patients with moderate to severe CD over 52 weeks.\\nParticipants were required to discontinue immunomodulators prior to\\ninitiation. This study showed similar efﬁcacy between the 2 groups at\\nweek 52: 65% in the ustekinumab group (n124/N191) vs. 61% in the\\nadalimumab (n119/N195), p ¼ 0.47. Interestingly, the rapidity of\\nresponse was also similar between the two groups. The subanalyses re-\\nported a trend toward more safety, less use of concomitant steroids and a\\nslightly better endoscopic response (particularly in patients with higher\\nendoscopic scores at baseline) in the ustekinumab group.\\nAdditional head to head trials have been conducted in the etrolizu-\\nmab study program (GARDENIA vs. inﬂiximab (Danese et al., 2021) and\\nHIBISCUS vs. adalimumab (Rubin et al., 2021)) and Guselkumab phase II\\nstudy (GALAXY vs. Ustekinumab (Sandborn et al., 2022)) which were\\npresented at the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) conference in\\n2020. These studies didn't show signiﬁcant differences in the primary\\nendpoints. More head to head trials are certainly under way and will help\\nus better position biological agents and small molecules in the treatment\\nalgorithm (Pouillon et al., 2020). Of note, the result of the ﬁrst positive\\nhead to head study (VARSITY) had been foreseen by prior indirect\\ncomparison information from network meta-analyses.\\n2.2. Network meta-analysis\\nWhen no head to head trials are available, network meta-analysis are\\nused to compare efﬁcacy of biologics agents against placebo.\\nOne of the ﬁrst meta-analyses, published in 2015, focused on the\\nefﬁcacy of ﬁrst line biological therapy in UC (Danese et al., 2014). The\\nauthors suggested that in naïve UC patients inﬂiximab and vedolizumab\\nare more effective in inducing clinical response (Odd ratios (OR) 5.33\\nand 4.51, resp.) and maintaining remission (OR 2.78 and 5.19 resp.)\\ncompared to other regimens. These observations were conﬁrmed in the\\nmost recent meta-analysis from the same group (Bonovas et al., 2018)\\nand another analysis that included ustekinumab (Singh et al., 2018a).\\nThis latter meta-analysis reported some beneﬁt of ustekinumab over\\nadalimumab or vedolizumab after anti-TNF exposure in UC patients.\\nAmong anti-TNF agents, inﬂiximab remains the most efﬁcient agent in\\nAbbreviations\\nCD\\nCrohn's disease\\nIBD\\ninﬂammatory bowel disease\\nOR\\nodd ratio\\nTNF\\nTumor Necrosis Factor alpha\\nUC\\nulcerative colitis\\nTable 1\\nCharacteristics of the available biologics.\\nP.

              "  Document(page_content=\"UC (Thorlund et al., 2015), but not in terms of cost effectiveness (Toor\\net al., 2015).\\nIn CD, a meta-analysis of 9 randomized trials with mixed ﬁrst-line and\\nsecond line indications conﬁrmed the superiority of inﬂiximab alone for\\ninduction (OR 2.8) or in combination with azathioprine for maintenance\\nof remission (OR 3.0) (Hazlewood et al., 2015). A recent pooled analysis\\nof 4 clinical trial programs (EXTEND, UNITY, VERSIFY, CPT-13 BIO-\\nSIMILAR) was presented at ECCO congress 2022 and conﬁrmed that\\ninﬂiximab achieved a higher proportion of 1-year endoscopic healing\\ncompared to adalimumab, ustekinumab and vedolizumab in CD patients,\\nbut not in bio-naïve patients (Narula et al., 2022).\\nAs second line therapy, it is also important to consider that the efﬁ-\\ncacy of vedolizumab will be inﬂuenced by previous anti-TNF exposure, a\\nnumerical difference was seen in the response to therapy in UC (Feagan\\net al., 2017) and CD patients (Sands et al., 2017). An impact which was\\nclearly signiﬁcant at week 6 after induction (Sands et al., 2014).\\nIn summary, the most recent meta-analysis in CD which included\\nustekinumab concluded that inﬂiximab or adalimumab are the best ﬁrst-\\nline agents, and ustekinumab a preferred second-line agent in patients\\nwith prior anti-TNF alpha agents’ exposure (Singh et al., 2018b).\\n2.3. Real life propensity score weighted data\\nAnother way to compare efﬁcacy between drugs is a retrospective\\nanalysis of prospective data from epidemiological cohort studies using\\nthe best adjustment of confounders. A good example of this a the Mayo\\nClinic study using propensity score matching to evaluate the efﬁcacy of\\nanti-TNF agents in >3000 biologic-naïve CD patients, extracted from a\\nnational administrative claims database (Singh et al., 2016). The authors\\ndemonstrated that inﬂiximab was associated with less hospitalization,\\nabdominal surgery and corticosteroid use compared to adalimumab and\\ncertolizumab.\\nAnother recent propensity score matched post hoc analysis of clinical\\ntrial programs compared inﬂiximab with the newcomer ustekinumab\\n(Narula et al., 2021a). This suggested a similar efﬁcacy of the two\\ncompounds as ﬁrst line biological agents in CD patients. The same\\nanalysis was conducted in naïve UC patients, which showed that inﬂix-\\nimab and had similar efﬁcacy based on clinical response, but a signiﬁcant\\nhigher rate of steroid free clinical remission (30% vs. 15%) and endo-\\nscopic remission (36% vs. 26%) was achieved in inﬂiximab treated pa-\\ntients (Narula et al., 2021b). The Sicilian Network for IBD reported\\nsimilar efﬁcacy for adalimumab and vedolizumab in CD patients in a\\npropensity score matched analysis of a cohort conducted between 2016\\nand 2019 (Macaluso et al., 2021), but superiority of vedolizumab in UC\\npatients (Macaluso et al., 2020). Finally, a propensity score matched\\nanalysis of a cohort conducted in Germany (the VEDO IBD study from\\nKompetenznetz Darmerkrankungen) has been presented at the recent\\nECCO congress 2022 comparing vedolizumab and anti-TNF agents in UC\\npatients. This work conﬁrmed a more persistent clinical response (61.7%\\nvs. 40.3%; OR 2.39 (95% CI 1.39–4.10)) and steroid-free remission\\n(36.5% vs. 24.0%; OR 1.82 (95% CI 1.00–3.34)) at one year under\\nvedolizumab (Plachta-Danielzik et al., 2022).\\n2.4. Available data on treatment sequences in algorithms and guidelines\\nData from the literature on strategies to position biological therapy is\\nscarce. Guidance and consensus statements exist to help aid the decision\\nmaking process. However there is a tendency to position all biologics on\\nthe same level and to consider them as interchangeable in the ECCO\\nGuidelines (Torres et al., 2020; Raine et al., 2021). These guidelines, used\\nthe novel Grade methodology which prioritizes meta-analyses (or\\nperform their own) to extract the necessary data to answer speciﬁc (so\\ncall PICO) questions on IBD management (e.g. for anti-TNF agents in UC)\\n(Raine et al., 2021)).\\nIn the most recent publication from the American Gastroenterology\\nAssociation: “Technical Review, the Medical Management of Moderate to\\nSevere Luminal and Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease”, the question of\\ncomparing the efﬁcacy between all available biologics is addressed\\n(Singh et al., 2021). The conclusion was that in biologic-naïve patients\\nwith moderate to severely active CD, inﬂiximab, adalimumab, and\\nustekinumab are the most effective compared to vedolizumab and cer-\\ntolizumab pegol. Inﬂiximab was considered the strongest for induction.\\nHowever, in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to inﬂiximab),\\nthe beneﬁt of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain. A\\nsummary of the efﬁcacies of the various biological agents, according to\\nthe line of treatment and previous treatment failures and patients'\\nphenotype, is provided in Table 2. The ﬁnal word about the efﬁcacy of\\nbiologics in IBD and the theoretical “therapeutic ceiling” which cannot be\\nbroken (Alsoud et al., 2021) could potentially come from combining\\nthese agents such as demonstrated by the recent VEGA study. This 3-arm\\ntrial presented as one of the highlights of the recent ECCO congress 2022,\\ncompared golimumab (GOL), guselkumab (GUS) and their combined use\\nduring induction period of 12 weeks. This showed a signiﬁcant higher\\nrate of clinical response (83% for combination therapy vs. 75% for GUS\\n(p ¼ 0.215) and 61% for GOL (p ¼ 0.003)) and clinical remission (47%\\nfor combination therapy vs. 24% for GUS (p ¼ 0.005) and 25% for GOL\\n(p ¼ 0.007) based on modiﬁed Mayo score) without added risks for safety\\nin moderate to severely active UC patients naïve to biologics (Sands et al.,\\n2022).\\n3. Personalizing choice of biologic\\n3.1. Prior biologic exposure\\nIn current clinical practice we are confronted with numerous options\\nof treatment sequencing. Personalizing IBD treatment depends on pre-\\nvious drug exposure IBD (1st, 2nd, 3rd line of treatment), prior treatment\\nresponse, comorbidities, safety proﬁle, patient preferences and patient\\nrisk for future IBD complications (disease severity). For example, primary\\nnon response to an anti-TNF was found to be a predictor for diminished\\ntreatment efﬁcacy with an anti-integrin biologic (Singh et al., 2018c).\\nFirst and second line agent treatment sequences and treatment response\\nhave been presented in the previous chapter. However, data are even\\nscarcer concerning third line of treatment after two anti-TNFs exposure.\\nA retrospective small series of 67 patients with Crohn's disease treated\\nwith 3rd line anti-TNF agent (Allez et al., 2010) reported a lower\\nresponse rate and the lack of late responders at 6 months. A recent\\nmulticenter retrospective study reported the outcome of patients with\\nlate CD who had failed treatment with one anti-TNF agent and either\\nvedolizumab or ustekinumab. After 48 weeks on a third line of biologic\\ntherapy the remission rate was 30.7% whereas the surgery rate was\\n23.5% (Kassouri et al., 2020).\\nThere is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD\\npatients. During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to re-\\nsponders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R,\\nand IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T\\ncells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests\\nthat ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor\\nagents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019)\\nwhen an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have\\noccurred.\\n3.2.

This is also a key point in the management of frail or\\nmalnourished patients (Kochar et al., 2020). A pooled analysis of data\\nfrom four randomized trials including 2257 UC patients reported that\\nolder patients have an increased baseline risk of adverse effects not\\nrelated to anti-TNF therapy. In older IBD patients, a protective effect\\nagainst the development of severe adverse events have been demon-\\nstrated in UC (OR 0.54 (0.35–0.83, p < 0.01) but not CD (OR 1.3\\n(0.8–1.20)) when administering vedolizumab compared to anti-TNF\\nagents (Cheng et al., 2021). Earlier publications, also suggested a very\\ngood safety of anti-TNF agents in older populations (Bonovas et al.,\\n2016). At this stage, we can thus consider all biological agents, when\\nindicated, as safe in all populations.\\nIn some large clinical trials, initiation of biologic therapy at a younger\\nage was associated with better response, for example inﬂiximab in both\\nCD and UC patients (Vermeire et al., 2002; Billiet et al., 2015). However,\\nother studies, (particularly in long term follow-up of patients cohorts),\\ndid not ﬁnd such an association as well as no differences in response\\naccording to gender (Ferrante et al., 2008; Sprakes et al., 2012; Arias\\net al., 2015; Iborra et al., 2017). Although much fewer studies are\\navailable, remission rates observed with vedolizumab in elderly and\\npediatric population appear to match those reported in the general adult\\npopulation (Asscher et al., 2020; Ibraheim et al., 2020). The same ob-\\nservations were also made for ustekinumab (Asscher et al., 2020; Conrad\\nand Kelsen, 2020; Gisbert and Chaparro, 2020).\\nObesity may contribute to the development and to the course of IBD\\nthrough\\naltered\\npharmacokinetics\\nand\\nobesity-mediated\\nchronic\\ninﬂammation (Singh et al., 2020). However, it remains unclear whether\\nobesity inﬂuences response to biological therapies. On the one hand, a\\nrecent meta-analysis that investigated the outcome of anti-TNF therapy\\nin IBD patients stratiﬁed by BMI, Dai et al. observed a higher rate of\\ntreatment failure in UC but not in CD patients with higher BMI (Dai et al.,\\n2020). On the other hand, other reports failed to ﬁnd an association\\nbetween BMI and treatment response in IBD (Singh et al., 2018d). At this\\nstage, there is little data on the impact of BMI on the response to vedo-\\nlizumab or ustekinumab in IBD, but response to the second was lower in a\\nstudy of obese patients with psoriasis (Pirro et al., 2021).\\nSarcopenia, often associated with malnutrition, has an important\\nimpact in IBD patients on quality of life, prognosis, outcome of surgical\\nTable 2\\nEfﬁcacy of biological treatments according to the line of treatment, earlier exposure, disease phenotype and patient characteristics.\\nP.

Only two studies investigated the direct effect of\\nbiological agents on sarcopenia: the ﬁrst reported an improvement of\\nquadriceps muscle volume and strength in CD patients after 25 weeks of\\ninﬂiximab treatment (Subramaniam et al., 2015), whereas Csontos et al.\\nobserved that UC and CD patients on anti-TNF agents had an improve-\\nment in fat free mass index after 12 week already (Csontos et al., 2016).\\n3.2.2. Disease duration, phenotype, genetics, biomarkers, and extraintestinal\\nmanifestations\\nShort duration of disease has long been associated with better\\nresponse to inﬂiximab as well as other anti-TNF agents. This was reported\\nin the ﬁrst pediatric randomized trial by Hyams et al., which yielded\\nbetter response and remission rates than observed in adults with longer\\nduration of disease. This observation later conﬁrmed in others pediatric\\nstudies (Hyams et al., 2007; Walters et al., 2014). Similarly, registration\\ntrials with adalimumab and certolizumab pegol, which stratiﬁed ac-\\ncording to disease duration showed better responses in patients with\\nshorter disease duration (Colombel et al., 2007; Schreiber et al., 2010). A\\nlarge meta-analysis of 60168 CD patients, conﬁrmed and extended this\\nobservation for other biological therapies, including golimumab and\\nvedolizumab (Ben-Horin et al., 2021). However, the same analyses,\\nfailed to show an association between disease duration and response in\\n30227 UC patients. Regarding vedolizumab, a retrospective analysis of\\nthe Swiss IBD cohort showed an impact of disease duration on response in\\nUC but not in CD patients (Mader et al., 2021). Very limited data are\\navailable regarding ustekinumab in early CD. In a retrospective pediatric\\ncohort, treated with ustekinumab, the rate of remission was 61.1% in\\npatients despite prior anti-TNF failure, suggesting a high potential with\\nthis agent in early disease (Kim et al., 2021).\\nDifferentiationcanalsobemade ontheextensionandlocationofdisease\\nwhich may have a direct impact on the response to biological treatment\\n(AtreyaandSiegmund,2021).Inarecentgeneticassociationstudy,Cleynen\\netal.determinedthattheseparationofIBDbetweenilealCD,colonicCDand\\nUCcouldbeconsideredas acontinuumofphenotypes,towhichspeciﬁc risk\\nscore could be applied (Cleynen et al., 2016). Concerning disease behavior,\\nbetter results were obtained in CD with anti-TNF agents in patients with\\nnon-stricturing, non-penetrating disease (B1 according to the Montr�eal\\nclassiﬁcation), as compared to stricturing disease (B2) or ﬁstulizing disease\\n(B3)(Moranetal.,2014;Bouhniketal.,2018;Nunez-Gomezetal.,2018).In\\nUC,onlylimiteddataareavailabletoguidetherapyofisolatedproctitiswith\\nbiological agents. In a national retrospective study in France, half of 104\\npatients with ulcerative proctitis achieved remission with various anti-TNF\\ntherapies and 60% achieved mucosal healing (Pineton de Chambrun et al.,\\n2020). In a large retrospective single center cohort, clinical response to\\nbiological therapy (mostly inﬂiximab) was obtained in 70% of 118 5-ASA\\nrefractory ulcerative proctitis patients, as compared to 11% with azathio-\\nprine (Dubois et al., 2020).\\nConcerning pouch patients, a recent large randomized, double-blind\\nplacebo-controlled study presented at ECCO congress, the EARNEST\\ntrial, was the ﬁrst signiﬁcant beneﬁts across multiple treatment outcomes\\nin patients with chronic pouchitis after IPAA for UC (Travis et al., 2022).\\nTill then our best options for pouchitis refractory to antibiotics were\\nmostly anti-TNF agents but without very high level of evidence (Kayal\\nand Dubinsky, 2022): only one randomized controlled trial with adali-\\nmumab (Kjær et al., 2019).\\nRecent studies have linked the risk of antibody development against\\nbiologic therapies, in particular anti-TNF agents, to the HLA proﬁle of\\npatients (Sazonovs et al., 2020, 2021). The authors associated the car-\\nriage of the HLA-DQA1*05 allele, common to 40% of Europeans, with a\\nhigher rate of immunogenicity to inﬂiximab and adalimumab. Although\\ndetails of the evidence has been discussed, the same association was\\nfound in the ABIRISK consortium in autoimmune diseases (Hassler et al.,\\n2020). Whether information on HLA allele carriage can be used pro-\\nspectively to identify patients at risk of developing antibodies for a spe-\\nciﬁc prospective intervention remains to be seen.\\nAlthough the serological biomarkers ASCA and pANCA have long\\nbeen used to help classify indeterminate colitis, their value in guiding\\nmedical therapy is still limited. A recent study associated presence of\\nASCA with extensive and severe disease phenotype and the need for an\\nearly use of biologics for a better prognosis in a cohort of 273 CD pedi-\\natric patients (Chandrakumar et al., 2019), whereas a meta-analysis\\nfound that pANCA positive IBD patients had a lower response rate to\\ninﬂiximab therapy (Nguyen et al., 2015).\\nExtraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and\\nrepresent an important cause of morbidity and disability (Vavricka et al.,\\n2011; Juillerat et al., 2020). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect\\n30% of patients. They include non-inﬂammatory joint pain as well as\\ninﬂammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as\\nspondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, inﬂiximab and later\\nthe other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD\\npatient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials\\nin both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established efﬁcacies in most\\nrheumatological indications (Herfarth et al., 2002; Generini et al., 2004;\\nLofberg et al., 2012; Louis et al., 2018).\\nVedolizumab may not represent the most appropriate biologic in\\npresence of articular manifestations of IBD. Indeed, by virtue of its\\nbinding to α4β7 integrin, this antibody may not impede the entry of\\nproinﬂammatory cells in joints. In fact, it may even contribute to higher\\ninﬂux of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who\\nobserved de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated\\nIBD patients (Diaz et al., 2020). An increased incidence of extra-\\nintestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also\\nbeen observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims\\ndatabase (Dubinsky et al., 2018). However, by improving disease activity\\nthese drugs could still have an indirect impact on associated EIM, mostly\\nperipheral arthritis, as suggested by the recent EMOTIVE retrospective\\nanalysis (Kopylov et al., 2021). Ustekinumab, however, has also limited\\nrole in this indication, as this drug is also indicated in rheumatoid\\narthritis (Kerschbaumer et al., 2020). Dermatological extraintestinal\\nmanifestations occur in up to 15% of IBD patients (Vavricka et al., 2011).\\nThe most common, erythema nodosum, depends on the underlying dis-\\nease activity, whereas pyoderma gangrenosum may be associated with\\nactive or inactive intestinal disease and requires rapid management, most\\ncommonly with systemic medication. Treatment includes oral cortico-\\nsteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and anti-TNF therapy (inﬂiximab or\\nadalimumab), drugs that have good efﬁcacy in several cases reports and\\nsmall case series (Juillerat et al., 2007). Cases reports and a recent\\nsemi-systematic review suggest that IBD cutaneous lesions may respond\\nto the newer IBD drugs. This is the case for ustekinumab and less\\nfrequently for vedolizumab (Phillips et al., 2020; Ben Abdallah et al.,\\n2021). Uveitis also appears to respond to anti-TNF agents (Leal et al.,\\n2019), whereas no biological agents, despite high expectations for\\nvedolizumab, has shown efﬁcacy in primary sclerosing cholangitis\\n(Christensen et al., 2018; Lynch et al., 2020).\\nFistula development affects up to 50% of CD patients over 20 years of\\ndisease course. Half of these patients experience perianal ﬁstula (Rub-\\nbino et al., 2021). After surgical drainage of pelvic sepsis, medical ther-\\napy may be undertaken. Best results so far are obtained with anti-TNF\\nagents. Among them, only inﬂiximab has been evaluated in a large,\\ndedicated placebo-randomized trial. Out of 366 patients who received\\ninduction with 5 mg/kg inﬂiximab at Week 0, 2 and 6, 195 responders\\nwere randomized to maintenance therapy or placebo. At Week 54, 36%\\nof inﬂiximab treated patients had a complete absence of ﬁstula against\\n19% in the placebo group (Sands et al., 2004). Regarding the other bi-\\nologicals, subanalyses of randomized trials showed effectiveness of\\nadalimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab in ﬁstula closure, however\\nthe patient numbers are limited. All the data regarding these studies are\\nput in perspective in the previously cited AGA Technical Review (Singh\\net al., 2021). Recently, a small, randomized trial prospectively tested two\\nvedolizumab regimens in ﬁstulizing CD patients with better results\\nachieved in the high dose group.

Safety was assessed in overall populations by all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, \\ndiscontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections.

Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were \\nhighest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance \\namong bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or \\nserious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to \\nAEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during \\nmaintenance.\\nConclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety \\nacross advanced therapies.\\nLay Summary \\nIndirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-\\nsion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across \\nadvanced therapies.\\nKey Words: ulcerative colitis, clinical trials, advanced therapies, network meta-analysis\\nIntroduction\\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-\\nease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized \\nby bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-\\nlaise, weight loss, and fever.

However, treatment limitations for \\nmoderately to severely active UC remain, including primary \\nnonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and \\nparenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, \\nthere has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs \\n(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-\\nnogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the \\nJanus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which \\ntofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are \\ncurrently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-\\nverely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-\\ntolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi’s.4–7 All orally \\nadministered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their \\nJAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and \\nUPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 \\nover JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-\\nerentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-\\ntional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs \\nof JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-\\ntively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), \\nis also approved for use in UC.10\\nWith this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid \\ntoward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of \\nbiologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of \\ndevelopment for moderately to severely active UC. Most \\nrecently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and \\npublished a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist \\nnetwork meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of \\nbiologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely \\nUC. Both studies assessed all outcomes after induction (6–14 \\nweeks); Lasa et al11 additionally assessed efficacy after main-\\ntenance (26–66 weeks) separately for treat-through (TT) and \\nre-randomized responders (RR) randomized clinical trials \\n(RCTs). Both studies also assessed all outcomes in overall \\npopulations, as well as induction efficacy outcomes by prior \\nbiologic exposure, though UPA was excluded from subgroup \\nanalyses in Lasa et al11 due to lack of published data.\\nDespite these recent publications, there remain key gaps \\nin our understanding of the comparative efficacy and safety \\nof advanced therapies for moderately to severely active UC. \\nFirst, an indirect comparison of maintenance treatment \\nsafety remains unpublished. Second, so far only separate \\nNMAs have been conducted for induction and maintenance \\ntreatments, when in practice clinicians would consider the \\noverall comparative efficacy of treatments across induction \\nand maintenance in their decision-making. Finally, Lasa et \\nal11 and Burr et al12 conducted their literature searches in \\nJuly 2021 and October 2021, respectively, and more data \\nhave become available to address the research question, \\nincluding more comprehensive UPA data from its phase 3 \\nRCT. We therefore performed Bayesian NMAs to determine \\nthe latest comparative efficacy and safety of all currently \\napproved biologics and SMDs for moderately to severely \\nactive UC. First, consistent with prior published NMAs, we \\nconducted separate NMAs for induction and maintenance \\ntreatments.11,12 Then, rather than burdening medical decision \\nmakers with the task of reconciling results from disparate \\nanalyses of induction and maintenance, we took the novel \\nadditional step to combine induction and maintenance NMA \\nresults to simulate absolute treatment efficacy in an intent-\\nto-treat (ITT) population of induction responders in an RR \\nmaintenance RCT.\\nMaterials and Methods\\nSearch Strategy\\nA clinical SLR was conducted per guidance from the Cochrane \\nHandbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,13 Centre \\nfor Reviews and Dissemination’s Guidance for Undertaking \\nReviews in Healthcare,14 and Methods for the Development \\nof National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) \\nPublic Health Guidance.15 Using the Ovid platform,16 searches \\nfor English-language publications of RCTs reporting the clin-\\nical efficacy and/or safety of relevant treatments for adults with \\nmoderately to severely active UC were conducted on January \\n6, 2022 (from inception of the databases) in MEDLINE, \\nEmbase, and other relevant databases. Keyword searches of \\nthe annual proceedings of relevant scientific meetings (from \\nlast 4 years) and clinical trial registers (no date limit) were \\nalso conducted for additional available data. Finally, the \\nbibliographies of SLRs and meta-analyses identified through \\ndatabase searches and selected key RCTs were reviewed to \\nensure literature saturation. Details of the search strategy are \\npresented in Appendix 1; the full SLR protocol has been reg-\\nistered with PROSPERO.17\\nStudy Selection\\nTitle/abstract and full-text screenings were conducted sequen-\\ntially and in parallel by 2 independent researchers to iden-\\ntify studies that met the SLR eligibility criteria, which are \\ndescribed in detail in Appendix 2. From the SLR, to meet the \\nstudy objectives and minimize between-study heterogeneity, a \\nnarrower set of inclusion criteria was imposed for the NMA \\nwhich is described in Table 1.\\nOutcomes\\nEfficacy outcomes based on the Full Mayo score (FMS) were \\nassessed as possible. The FMS consists of 4 items, each with \\na subscore that ranges from 0 to 3 whole points: stool fre-\\nquency subscore (SFS), rectal bleeding subscore (RBS), en-\\ndoscopic Mayo subscore (EMS), and physician’s global \\nassessment (PGA).18 The efficacy outcomes analyzed by prior \\nbiologic exposure were clinical response (decrease from base-\\nline in FMS ≥3 points and ≥30%, accompanied by a decrease \\nin RBS of ≥1 or an absolute RBS ≤1), clinical remission (FMS \\n≤2 with no subscore >1), and endoscopic improvement (EMS \\n≤1). Deviations from these definitions are noted in Appendix \\n5. The safety outcomes analyzed in the overall populations \\nwere all adverse events (AEs), discontinuation due to AEs, \\nserious AEs, and serious infections, as reported in the RCT \\npublications. Only outcomes evaluated during randomized, \\ndouble-blinded phases were considered.

Two researchers independently rated the \\nquality of the included RCTs using the Cochrane Risk of Bias \\ntool, version 2.0.19 For UPA, FMS outcomes were obtained \\nfrom ad hoc analyses of its patient-level trial data.\\nWhile Lasa et al11 conducted separate NMAs on the ef-\\nficacy of maintenance treatments assessed in TT versus RR \\ntrials, we instead combined them by adjusting the observed \\ndata from TT trials to mimic those of RR trials, based on the \\nassumption that the number of responders at the end of in-\\nduction is a proxy for the total number of patients entering \\nmaintenance. Thus, to the extent that they are reported, clin-\\nical outcomes for induction responder subset of TT trials \\nwere used. If induction responder data were not reported, \\nthen values were assumed per the Evidence Review Group \\n(ERG) maintenance-only NMA in the NICE submission \\nfor UST in UC (TA633).20 Accepted and used by the NICE-\\ncommissioned ERG, this imputation had one noted draw-\\nback—it ignored nonresponders at the end of the induction \\nphase who could have potentially become responders by the \\nend of the maintenance phase.20 Details of the TT-to-RR ad-\\njustment are described in Appendix 6.\\nData Analysis\\nPer NICE guidelines, NMAs were conducted in a Generalized \\nLinear Model (GLM) framework using a binomial likelihood, \\nlogit link, and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) \\nsimulation with 3 chains of 100 000 posterior iterations \\neach.21 Models were considered to converge when their \\nPotential Scale Reduction Factor (PSRF) fell below 1.05.22 \\nBy default, independent baseline (placebo [PBO]) risks were \\nassumed and noninformative prior distributions were used \\n(normal [0, 1002] for continuous parameters and uniform [0, \\n5] for the between-study heterogeneity SD of a random effects \\n[RE] model). Deviations from these defaults were made to \\naccount for data sparsity (eg, exchangeable baseline assump-\\ntion when ≥1 PBO arms have zero events, slightly informative \\nhalf-normal [0, 0.322] prior for SD when ≥50% of treatments \\nin a network are informed by a single RCT). RE models \\nwere utilized to account for expected heterogeneity in trial \\nendpoints and study design. RE models adjusted for baseline \\nrisk were selected if the model successfully converged and \\nif the associated meta-regression term was significant (95% \\ncredible interval [CrI] excluded zero). In networks with evi-\\ndence loops, network consistency was assessed by comparing \\nthe fit of an RE unrelated mean effects (UME) model to the \\nassociated RE model NMA.23\\nFrom each logit NMA, pairwise odds ratios (ORs; median \\nand 95% CrI), surface under the cumulative ranking curve \\n(SUCRA) values, and absolute rates were estimated to inform \\nrelative treatment effect size, statistical significance, and treat-\\nment rankings. SUCRA serves as a numerical summary for \\nthe probability of each treatment being ranked first, second, \\nthird, and so on; SUCRA would be 100% for the most fa-\\nvorable treatment (ie, has the highest efficacy rate or lowest \\nsafety event rate) and 0% for the least favorable treatment in \\nthe network (ie, has the lowest efficacy rate or highest safety \\nTable 1.

Ultimately, 293 records covering 48 original RCTs \\nwere included in the SLR (Figure 1). From SLR to NMA, 23 \\nRCTs reported by 62 records were found eligible, of which 18 \\n(39 records; 8823 patients) contributed data to the induction \\nnetwork (Figure 2) and 14 (47 records; 5321 patients) to the \\nmaintenance network (Figure 3). A total of 25 RCTs were \\nexcluded due to study characteristics (eg, phase 2, open-label, \\nsingle-arm), outcomes (eg, outside of eligible timeframes, \\nnot Mayo score based), and/or interventions (eg, not a bio-\\nlogic/SMD of interest). An overview of the 23 included RCTs \\nand their baseline characteristics by induction and mainte-\\nnance populations are presented in Appendix 3. The included \\nRCT populations were largely comparable in their baseline \\ncharacteristics, though some heterogeneity was noted in \\nweight, disease duration, extent of disease, and concomitant \\nmedications. A risk of bias assessment showed a low risk of \\nbias for all included RCTs, which were all industry sponsored \\n(Appendix 4).\\nThe outcome contributions and definitions of included \\nRCTs are described in Appendix 5. For induction, 18 and 10 \\nRCTs contributed efficacy data for bio-naive and -exposed \\npopulations, respectively, and 14 RCTs contributed safety \\ndata for overall populations. For maintenance, 12 and 9 \\nRCTs contributed efficacy data for bio-naive and -exposed \\npopulations, respectively, and 14 RCTs contributed safety \\ndata for overall populations. The following differences in \\noutcome definitions across the RCTs were observed: location \\nof endoscopic reading (generally local in RCTs for biologics \\nvs central in RCTs for SMDs), Mayo score type (all RCTs \\nreported FMS except for TRUE NORTH which only re-\\nported an adapted Mayo score [AMS] that excluded the PGA \\nsubscore), treatment duration (6–10 weeks induction with \\nmost RCTs at 8 weeks, and 42–54 weeks maintenance), and \\nprior biologic experience (most studies defined experience \\nusing exposure with some defining it using failure). Of note, \\ninduction safety outcomes were assessed after 10 weeks in 2 \\nRCTs (Japic CTI-060298 at 14 weeks and SELECTION at \\n11 weeks) but were included to be able to assess INF and FIL \\n(Appendix 5).\\nOf the 14 included maintenance RCTs, 11 (GEMINI 1, \\nNCT02039505, OCTAVE Sustain, PURSUIT-J, PURSUIT-M, \\nSELECTION, SERENE-UC, TRUE NORTH, U-ACHIEVE, \\nUNIFI, and VISIBLE 1) had RR designs and 3 (ACT-1, M10-\\n447, and ULTRA-2) had TT designs.

              "  Document(page_content='12\\nEfficacy and Safety of Advanced Therapies\\nDiscussion\\nWith a growing number of advanced therapies available for \\nmoderately to severely active UC, it is important for clinicians \\nto better understand the relative efficacy and safety of avail-\\nable options. In the absence of direct comparisons gained \\nin head-to-head studies, indirect comparisons conducted \\nthrough NMAs provide clinicians valuable insights that \\nmay aid in their decision-making. In the present study, we \\nconfirmed the findings of recent NMAs by Lasa et al11 and \\nBurr et al12 that UPA 45 mg was the most efficacious induc-\\ntion therapy, significantly so versus most comparators and \\nindependent of prior biologic exposure, at inducing clinical \\nresponse, clinical remission, and endoscopic improvement. \\nFor maintenance results based on induction responders only \\n(not per ITT), we confirmed the finding by Lasa et al11 that \\nUPA 30 mg had high comparative efficacy, ranking first \\nfor all outcomes except for clinical remission in bio-naive \\npopulations, where it ranked fourth after TOF10, TOF5, and \\nFIL200.\\nGoing beyond the scope of currently published NMAs, \\nwe simulated the absolute ITT efficacies of treatments in \\nan RR maintenance trial by multiplying the MCMC chains \\nof treatments’ induction clinical response rates with each \\nof their maintenance clinical response, clinical remission, \\nand endoscopic improvement rates. The resulting ITT rates \\nshow UPA45 induction followed by UPA30 maintenance for \\nresponders (UPA45 × UPA30) as most efficacious for all 3 ef-\\nficacy outcomes in both bio-naive and -exposed populations. \\nFurthermore, UPA45 induction followed by UPA15 mainte-\\nnance for responders (UPA45 × UPA15) came second for all \\nefficacy outcomes except for clinical remission in bio-naive \\npopulations, for which TOF 10 mg induction and mainte-\\nnance for responders (TOF10 × TOF10) came second. These \\nITT estimates of efficacy provide a more holistic approach for \\nclinicians to assess and decide the appropriate UC treatment \\nfor their patients.\\nThe presentation of ITT efficacy after induction and \\nmaintenance is a novel component of this study. We believe \\nthis to be a straightforward, interpretable approach to ad-\\ndress an inherent limitation of maintenance NMA efficacy \\nresults which must be interpreted as contingent on induction \\nresponse. As a validation of this approach, ITT results can \\nbe compared against a TT trial not included in the NMA, \\nnamely VARSITY.31 The VARSITY study is a TT, head-to-\\nhead study of VED versus ADA that was excluded from the \\nNMA as it lacked sufficient data to conduct TT-to-RR effi-\\ncacy imputation. VARSITY reported the endpoint durable \\nclinical remission, defined as clinical remission at both weeks \\n14 and 52. This endpoint is akin to ITT clinical remission, al-\\nbeit in an ITT population defined by a later timepoint induc-\\ntion remission rather than induction response. Despite this \\ndifference, similar absolute efficacy can likely be expected for \\ndurable clinical remission and ITT clinical remission. Indeed, \\nVARSITY reported the durable clinical remission absolute ef-\\nficacy of VED and ADA in the overall population to be 18.3% \\nand 11.9%, respectively. These rates observed in the TT \\ntrial are between the respective ITT clinical remission rates \\nestimated in the NMA in bio-naive (25.0% and 12.2%, re-\\nspectively) and bio-exposed (13.2% and 5.8%, respectively) \\npopulations.31 In all, this provides external validity for the \\nITT methodology, and at a minimum for the ITT clinical re-\\nmission of VED and ADA.\\nRegarding safety, the present NMA observed only a \\nhandful of significant differences between treatments and \\nPBO for the 4 safety events assessed (ie, all AEs, discontin-\\nuation due to AEs, serious AEs, serious infections) during \\ninduction and maintenance. Discontinuation rates are im-\\nportant to consider because they may signal a balance be-\\ntween drug efficacy and drug safety. Specifically, relative to \\nPBO, UPA45 was significantly better at avoiding discontin-\\nuation due to AEs during induction, GOL100 was signif-\\nicantly worse at avoiding all AEs during maintenance, and \\nboth UST90Q8W and VED300Q8W were significantly better \\nat avoiding discontinuation due to AEs during maintenance. \\nNo significant difference between all treatments versus PBO \\nwas observed for serious infections and serious AEs. Lasa et \\nal11 likewise observed insignificant and minimal differences \\nbetween treatments for all and serious AEs during induction, \\nrespectively. No published NMA to date has assessed treat-\\nment safety during maintenance. Together, these observations \\nsuggest that the safety profiles of currently approved biologics \\nand SMDs for moderately to severely active UC are generally \\ncomparable. However, the NMA methodology may be limited \\nFigure 5.

              "  Document(page_content='Panaccione et al\\n15\\nat identifying significant differences in safety outcomes given \\nthat rates of safety events, particularly serious ones, observed \\nin phase 3 RCTs are considerably lower relative to efficacy \\noutcomes.23\\nOur study included RCTs evaluating INF, ADA, GOL, \\nVED, UST, TOF, FIL, OZA, and UPA. Deviating from Lasa \\net al11 and Burr et al,12 we did not consider etrolizumab \\nnor the subcutaneous (SC) formulation of VED and INF \\nmaintenance to be relevant interventions but included all \\napproved maintenance doses of TOF (5 or 10 mg BID), \\nintravenous (IV) VED (every 4 or 8 weeks), UST (every \\n8 or 12 weeks), ADA (every 1 or 2 weeks), GOL (50 or \\n100 mg), and IV INF (5 or 10 mg/kg) as separate nodes in \\nthe networks. After imposing duration limits for induction \\n(6–10 weeks) and maintenance (at least 40 weeks) to mini-\\nmize outcome heterogeneity, which Lasa et al11 and Burr et \\nal12 did not account for, we synthesized efficacy and safety \\nevidence from 23 phase 3 RCTs. Even with these differences \\nin the evidence base, recent NMAs—those conducted in \\n2021 or later—generally show similar distributions of \\ntreatment rankings.11,12 An earlier published NMA that \\nexcluded the more recent therapies (ie, FIL, OZA, and UPA) \\nfound INF to be most efficacious in bio-naive populations, \\nand UST and TOF to be most efficacious in bio-exposed \\npopulations.32\\nIn contrast to recently published NMAs of maintenance \\ntreatments in moderately to severely active UC,11,32 instead \\nof conducting separate NMAs for RR and TT maintenance \\ntrials, we combined them in the same NMAs using the \\nTT-to-RR efficacy imputation approved and used by the ERG \\nfor TA633.20 In every network, we addressed concerns of het-\\nerogenous treatment carryover effects and/or baseline risks \\nby (1) assessing the significance of baseline (PBO) risk het-\\nerogeneity; (2) testing the selected model with baseline risk \\nadjustment; and (3) if baseline risk heterogeneity was signifi-\\ncant but adjustment did not converge or run, testing the RD \\nmodel assuming FE. Ultimately, baseline risk adjustment was \\nsuccessful and selected in 2 networks (ie, induction clinical \\nresponse in bio-naive populations and all AEs) and of the 7 \\nRD models tested, none substantially changed the original \\nconclusions.\\nThe present study has several limitations besides the \\nusual limitations of NMAs (ie, dependence on assumptions \\nof transitivity and consistency, susceptibility to the meth-\\nodological quality of included RCTs).33,34 First, there are \\nimportant sources of heterogeneity across the included \\nRCTs. For example, endoscopic readings were generally \\nperformed locally in older RCTs of biologic agents and \\ncentrally in newer RCTs of SMDs, potentially resulting in \\nhigher PBO rates for biologics.35 However, baseline risk \\nadjustments in the present study would have mitigated \\nmuch of this heterogeneity. Another source of heteroge-\\nneity is the use of AMS rather than FMS in the RCTs for \\nUPA and OZA to re-randomize patients and/or define treat-\\nment efficacy. In the present study, FMS outcomes were \\nobtained for UPA from ad hoc analyses of its patient-level \\ndata, which were not available for Lasa et al11 and Burr et \\nal.12 Given that results were directionally similar across the \\npresent study, Lasa et al,11 and Burr et al,12 a large differ-\\nence in AMS outcomes for OZA would not be expected. \\nAn additional limitation of the present study is related to \\nthe imputation of TT-to-RR maintenance efficacy, which \\nintroduced assumptions (eg, number of responders at end \\nof induction is a proxy for the total number of patients en-\\ntering maintenance) into the NMA dataset. However, sim-\\nilar assumptions were likewise used in the NICE assessment \\nof UST for UC.20 Additionally, evidence produced by this \\nNMA, which sourced treatment efficacy and safety data \\nfrom industry-sponsored RCTs, should be weighed in the \\ncontext of real-world data when available. Incorporation \\nof any future academic studies, especially studies utilizing \\nhead-to-head trial design, would likely improve the gener-\\nalizability of the NMA. Finally, as noted by Lasa et al,11 \\nseveral newer biologics currently in phase 2 of clinical de-\\nvelopment, especially anti-IL-23 drugs (ie, risankizumab, \\nmirikizumab, guselkumab, and brazikumab), are also ex-\\npected to yield phase 3 RCT results, so another update of \\nthis NMA may soon be necessary.\\nConclusion\\nThe present study suggests that UPA 45 mg induction and \\n30 mg maintenance may be overall highest performing ad-\\nvanced treatment at inducing and maintaining clinical re-\\nsponse, clinical remission, and endoscopic improvement in \\npatients with moderately to severely active UC, regardless \\nof prior biologic exposure. It also suggests that the safety \\nprofiles of currently approved advanced treatments, to the \\nextent that they can be indirectly assessed with NMA, are \\ngenerally consistent. As with any indirect comparison, the \\nresults presented in the present study should be interpreted \\nwith caution and in the context of a patient’s individual \\nneeds. However, given the limited evidence from head-to-\\nhead trials, these results can help clinicians better under-\\nstand the growing repertoire of advanced treatments for \\nmoderately to severely active UC.\\nSupplementary Data\\nSupplementary data is available at Crohn’s and Colitis 360 \\nonline.\\nFunding\\nThis work was supported by AbbVie Inc., who funded this \\nstudy and participated in the study design, research, analy-\\nsis, data collection, interpretation of data, reviewing, and ap-\\nproval of the publication.

Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and\\nendoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We\\nperformed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated\\nodds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative\\nranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of\\nRecommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).\\nRESULTS:\\nIn biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR\\nvs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)\\n(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]).

Two\\nstudy investigators (M.F. and S.S.) independently rated\\nthe quality of included trials using the Cochrane Risk of\\nBias Tool.11\\nOutcomes\\nFor trials of induction therapy, the efﬁcacy outcome\\nwas induction of clinical remission (deﬁned as a Mayo\\nClinic score of �2, with no individual subscore >1), and\\nendoscopic improvement (deﬁned as an endoscopy\\nsubscore of Mayo Clinic score of 0 or 1). Recognizing\\nlimitations of short-term trials in evaluating treatment\\nsafety, we qualitatively synthesized the overall safety of\\nall agents, regardless of ﬁrst- or second-line therapy, and\\npresented the results as proportion of patients with any\\nadverse event, adverse events leading to drug discon-\\ntinuation, serious adverse events, and serious infections.\\nFor trials of maintenance therapy, efﬁcacy outcomes\\nwere maintenance of clinical remission and endoscopic\\nimprovement, and safety outcomes were serious adverse\\nevents\\n(study-deﬁned)\\nand\\ninfections,\\nwhich\\nwere\\nanalyzed quantitatively. In addition, we qualitatively\\nreviewed the risk of any adverse events, adverse events\\nresulting in treatment discontinuation, and risk of\\nserious infections. Additional details of outcome assess-\\nment are shown in the Supplementary Appendix.\\nData Synthesis and Statistical Analysis\\nPooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated\\nusing the Mantel–Haenszel ﬁxed-effects model (in the\\nabsence of conceptual heterogeneity and if <5 studies),\\nwith sensitivity analysis using the DerSimonian–Liard\\nrandom-effects model.11–13 We assessed statistical het-\\nerogeneity using the I2 statistic, with values greater than\\n50% suggesting substantial heterogeneity. Publication\\nbias was assessed by evaluating small study effects by\\nexamining funnel plot asymmetry.14 Direct comparisons\\nwere performed using RevMan v53 (Cochrane Collabo-\\nration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Next, we conducted\\nnetwork meta-analysis using a consistency model of\\nmultivariate,\\nrandom-effects\\nmeta-regression\\nas\\ndescribed by White et al,15 using STATA v.15.0 (College\\nStation, TX). This frequentist approach provides a point\\nestimate from the network along with 95% CIs from the\\nfrequency distribution of the estimate.\\nWe calculated the relative ranking of agents for in-\\nduction of clinical remission as their surface under the\\ncumulative ranking (SUCRA), which represents the per-\\ncentage of efﬁcacy or safety achieved by an agent\\ncompared with an imaginary agent that is always the\\nbest without uncertainty (ie, SUCRA ¼ 100%).16 Higher\\nSUCRA scores correspond to higher ranking for induction\\nof clinical remission and/or endoscopic improvement,\\nand higher ranking for safety (ie, lowest risk of serious\\nadverse events and infections).\\nConﬁdence in Estimates\\nWe followed the GRADE approach to appraise the\\nconﬁdence in estimates derived from network meta-\\nanalysis of efﬁcacy outcomes.8 In this approach, direct\\nevidence from RCTs starts at high conﬁdence and can be\\nrated down based on risk of bias, indirectness, impreci-\\nsion, inconsistency (or heterogeneity), and/or publica-\\ntion bias, to levels of moderate, low, and very low\\nconﬁdence. The rating of indirect estimates starts at the\\nlowest rating of the 2 pairwise estimates that contribute\\nas ﬁrst-order loops to the indirect estimate but can be\\nrated down further for imprecision or intransitivity\\n(dissimilarity between studies in terms of clinical or\\nFigure 1.

Second, in patients with moderate–severe\\nulcerative colitis with prior exposure to TNFa antago-\\nnists, tofacitinib and ustekinumab are ranked highest for\\ninducing remission, and both of these agents are more\\neffective than vedolizumab or adalimumab, with mod-\\nerate conﬁdence in estimates. Of note, there were no\\ntrials of inﬂiximab or golimumab as second-line agents,\\nwhich limits inference on their efﬁcacy if used in the\\nsetting of prior TNFa antagonist exposure. Third, vedo-\\nlizumab was ranked safest, with the lowest rate of in-\\nfections\\namong\\nactive\\ninterventions,\\nfollowed\\nby\\nustekinumab. As compared with previous estimates, this\\nupdated analysis has key strengths with inclusion of a\\nhead-to-head trial comparing vedolizumab and adali-\\nmumab, which forms a more connected network, and\\nprovides more robust and statistically and clinically\\nsigniﬁcant results on the comparative efﬁcacy of second-\\nline pharmacotherapy in patients with prior exposure to\\nTNFa antagonists. Notable new ﬁndings are the relative\\nlowering efﬁcacy of vedolizumab as a ﬁrst-line agent for\\ninduction of remission than prior estimates, and the\\nsigniﬁcantly superior efﬁcacy of ustekinumab and tofa-\\ncitinib over vedolizumab as second-line agents in pa-\\ntients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists.

              "  Document(page_content='improvement on comparison of treat straight-through\\nmaintenance trials.\\nPerhaps the most informative results from our ana-\\nlyses pertain to the comparative efﬁcacy of different\\nagents in patients with prior exposure to TNFa antago-\\nnists. This is increasingly relevant given the high rates of\\nprimary nonresponse or secondary loss of response to\\ninitial biologic therapy, and is an often-faced clinical\\nscenario for which there is limited guidance. We\\nobserved that both ustekinumab and tofacitinib were\\nsigniﬁcantly more effective than vedolizumab and adali-\\nmumab for induction of remission. Findings from these\\nindirect comparisons need to be interpreted with caution\\nbecause these trials did not always mirror clinical prac-\\ntice. For example, current trials did not use therapeutic\\ndrug monitoring to understand the plausible mechanism\\nof failure of initial biologic intervention. Given the po-\\ntential differences in the efﬁcacy of second-line in-\\nterventions depending on the underlying reason for\\ndiscontinuation of prior TNFa antagonists (primary\\nnonresponse vs secondary loss of response vs intoler-\\nance), such information may be useful in making clinical\\ntreatment decisions in conjunction with ﬁndings from\\nour analyses.33,34 In these analyses, data on how many\\nprior TNFa antagonists to which a patient had been\\nexposed was not reported consistently. It is conceivable\\nthat because TNFa antagonists were the ﬁrst class of\\nmedications to be approved, patients treated with ada-\\nlimumab or golimumab in clinical trials generally had\\nexposure to only a single TNFa antagonist; in contrast, in\\nsubsequent trials of vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and uste-\\nkinumab, a signiﬁcant proportion of patients may have\\nbeen exposed to 2 or more biologic agents before clinical\\ntrial intervention, and inherently may be difﬁcult to treat.\\nHowever,\\ntrials\\nof\\nustekinumab\\nwere\\nconducted\\nfollowing approval of vedolizumab, and a subset of pa-\\ntients in these trials failed multiple TNFa antagonists and\\nvedolizumab, conceivably making it a more refractory\\npatient population. Despite this, we observed the supe-\\nriority of ustekinumab over vedolizumab, suggesting the\\neffect likely is real and not confounded by treatment\\nrefractoriness.\\nIn this study, by updating analyses with the inclusion\\nof ustekinumab, accounting for dose change for tofaciti-\\nnib, including a head-to-head trial of biologics in\\nmoderate–severe\\nulcerative\\ncolitis,\\nappropriately\\ncomparing trials of maintenance therapy with different\\ndesigns, adding the GRADE framework and assessment\\nof absolute effect size, and performing a thorough\\nquantitative and qualitative assessment of the safety of\\ndifferent therapies, we have been able to contextualize\\nour conﬁdence in the summary estimates for different\\ncomparisons, and more thoroughly inform positioning of\\ndifferent\\nagents\\nused\\nin\\nthe\\ntreatment\\nof\\nmoderate–severe ulcerative colitis. We acknowledge that\\nthere is a paucity of head-to-head trials to truly inform\\ncomparative efﬁcacy and safety. However, it is important\\nto note that across trials of induction therapy, key\\ninclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome deﬁnitions, and\\npatient and clinical characteristics, co-interventions were\\ncomparable across trials, which facilitated this network\\nmeta-analysis.\\nBesides inherent limitations of individual trials, there\\nwere limitations to our analyses. A thorough comparative\\nanalysis across all agents was limited to trials of induc-\\ntion therapy; because of differences in trial design of\\nmaintenance therapy, we had to conduct 2 separate\\nnetwork meta-analyses limiting comparative assess-\\nments. Approaches to conducting network meta-analyses\\nwhen study designs are different have been proposed,\\nbut it is difﬁcult to assess their validity.35,36 Most of the\\nincluded trials relied on local investigators for endo-\\nscopic reading of endoscopic disease activity for trial\\nrecruitment and outcome assessment, whereas trials of\\ntofacitinib and ustekinumab included blinded central\\nreaders, which can inﬂuence absolute event rates of\\nclinical remission and endoscopic improvement. In\\naddition, the efﬁcacy outcome in OCTAVE induction trials\\nof tofacitinib were more robust, requiring a rectal\\nbleeding subscore of 0.26 There were differences in\\ntiming of outcomes assessment in induction studies\\n(weeks 6–14), and time-dependent variability in efﬁcacy\\ncould not be analyzed in detail. Although corticosteroid-\\nfree remission may be a more relevant clinical end point,\\nthis was reported inconsistently in the included trials;\\nacross all trials of induction therapy, no corticosteroid\\ntapering was attempted. We are unable to inform the\\ncomparative efﬁcacy of biologic monotherapy vs combi-\\nnation therapy with immunomodulators. We speciﬁcally\\nopted to exclude UC-SUCCESS for the following reasons:\\ninclusion of this trial with 3 active arms (including 1 arm\\nof thiopurine monotherapy) would have resulted in a\\ndisconnected network, and the efﬁcacy of thiopurine\\nmonotherapy as a separate intervention would have\\nbeen hard to interpret and biased because other older\\ntrials of thiopurines for induction and maintenance,\\nwhich systematically were different from contemporary\\ntrials, were being excluded. This trial has suggested that\\nin patients who are naïve to biologics and immuno-\\nmodulators, combination therapy of inﬂiximab and thi-\\nopurines\\nmay\\nbe\\nmore\\nefﬁcacious\\nthan\\ninﬂiximab\\nmonotherapy for achieving endoscopic improvement, but\\nnot clinical remission. We also urge caution in inter-\\npreting our ﬁndings solely in terms of ranking or SUCRA.\\nThere are no thresholds for clinically meaningful differ-\\nences between SUCRA values between different agents,\\nand generally, values closer to 1 suggest that the inter-\\nvention may be among the top-ranking interventions,\\nand values closer to 0 suggest that the intervention may\\nbe among the bottom ranking interventions. SUCRA does\\nnot consider the magnitude of differences in effects be-\\ntween treatments, for which we rely on ORs of speciﬁc\\ncomparisons.\\nBeyond treatment efﬁcacy, safety is an integral part in\\ndetermining risk–beneﬁt balance of each intervention\\nand\\ninforming\\nshared\\ndecision\\nmaking.37\\nAlthough\\nSeptember 2020\\nManagement of Moderate–Severe UC 2189\\n', metadata={'source': '/mnt/c/Users/QUAN/Desktop/medical-chatbot/data/document_store/uc/PIIS1542356520300446.pdf', 'file_path': '/mnt/c/Users/QUAN/Desktop/medical-chatbot/data/document_store/uc/PIIS1542356520300446.pdf', 'page': 10, 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis', 'author': 'Siddharth Singh', 'subject': 'Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, 18 (2020) 2179-2197. doi:10.1016/j.cgh.2020.01.008', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Elsevier', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20200816062640+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20200816062734+05'30'\", 'trapped': '', 'modal': 'text'}),\n",

Vedolizumab:\\n   - Advantages:\\n     - Vedolizumab has been shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission in biologic-naïve patients with moderate-severe UC.\\n     - It is a gut-selective agent, which may be beneficial for patients with extraintestinal manifestations.\\n     - Vedolizumab has a good safety profile and is associated with a lower risk of infections compared to other biologics.\\n   - Disadvantages:\\n     - Response to vedolizumab may be lower in patients who have been previously exposed to TNF inhibitors.\\n     - It may not be the most appropriate biologic for patients with articular manifestations of UC, as it may not impede the entry of proinflammatory cells into the joints.\\n     - There is a risk of infusion reactions and other side effects associated with vedolizumab treatment.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific characteristics, preferences, and the clinical judgment of the healthcare provider. It is recommended to consult with a gastroenterologist or healthcare professional experienced in the management of UC to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for the patient.\"}"
