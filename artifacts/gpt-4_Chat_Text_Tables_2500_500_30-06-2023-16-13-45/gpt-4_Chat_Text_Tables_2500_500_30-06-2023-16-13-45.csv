BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

First-line
pharmacotherapy
for
moderate–severe
ulcerative colitis. Overall, 15 RCTs including 3747 bio-
logic-naïve patients with moderate–severe ulcerative
colitis, treated with inﬂiximab (4 trials, 667 patients),
adalimumab (4 trials, 1046 patients), golimumab (2 tri-
als, 586 patients), vedolizumab (3 trials, 630 patients),
tofacitinib (2 trials, 520 patients), and ustekinumab (1
trial, 298 patients) were included; 1 trial compared
adalimumab vs vedolizumab.
Induction
of
clinical
remission. On
direct
meta-
analysis, all agents were superior to placebo for induc-
tion of clinical remission, and effect size was strongest
for inﬂiximab (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.68–6.16) and vedoli-
zumab (OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.53–6.26), with minimal to
moderate heterogeneity across estimates (I2 < 35%)
(Supplementary Figure 2A). On network meta-analysis,
compared with placebo there was moderate conﬁdence
in
estimates
supporting
the
use
of
inﬂiximab,
adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and
ustekinumab for induction of clinical remission in bio-
logic-naïve patients (evidence was rated down owing to
imprecision caused by a low event rate) (Table 2). On
comparison of active interventions, there was moderate
conﬁdence in estimates supporting the use of inﬂiximab
over adalimumab (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.16–3.79); none of
the other comparisons between active interventions
were signiﬁcantly different (Table 2). Overall, inﬂiximab
(SUCRA, 0.95) was ranked highest for inducing clinical
remission
in
biologic-naïve
patients

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

text: Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were
included. Phase 2 RCTs were excluded because of their small sample sizes and inclusion of doses not further explored
in phase 3 RCTs. Summary data from intention-to-treat analyses were extracted from included reports by JSL and PAO.
The primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission. A network meta-analysis was done under the frequentist
framework, obtaining pairwise odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA)
was used to rank the included agents for each outcome. Higher SUCRA scores correlate with better efficacy, whereas
lower SUCRA scores correlate with better safety. Maintenance data on efficacy for treat-straight-through and
randomised responder trials are also presented. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021225329.
Findings Our search yielded 5904 results, from which 29 studies (four being head-to-head RCTs) fulfilled our inclusion
criteria and were included. Of these, 23 studies assessed induction therapy with either a biologic or small molecule
drug, comprising 10 061 patients with ulcerative colitis. A risk of bias assessment showed a low risk of bias for most
of the included studies. Upadacitinib was significantly superior to all other interventions for the induction of clinical
remission (infliximab [OR 2·70, 95% CI 1·18–6·20], adalimumab [4·64, 2·47–8·71], golimumab [3·00, 1·32–6·82],

1·18–6·20), and ranked highest for the induction of clinical remission (SUCRA 0·996). No differences between active
interventions were observed when assessing adverse events and serious adverse events. Vedolizumab ranked lowest

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Induction Therapy
First-line
pharmacotherapy
for
moderate–severe
ulcerative colitis. Overall, 15 RCTs including 3747 bio-
logic-naïve patients with moderate–severe ulcerative
colitis, treated with inﬂiximab (4 trials, 667 patients),
adalimumab (4 trials, 1046 patients), golimumab (2 tri-
als, 586 patients), vedolizumab (3 trials, 630 patients),
tofacitinib (2 trials, 520 patients), and ustekinumab (1
trial, 298 patients) were included; 1 trial compared
adalimumab vs vedolizumab.
Induction
of
clinical
remission. On
direct
meta-
analysis, all agents were superior to placebo for induc-
tion of clinical remission, and effect size was strongest
for inﬂiximab (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.68–6.16) and vedoli-
zumab (OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.53–6.26), with minimal to
moderate heterogeneity across estimates (I2 < 35%)
(Supplementary Figure 2A). On network meta-analysis,
compared with placebo there was moderate conﬁdence
in
estimates
supporting
the
use
of
inﬂiximab,
adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and
ustekinumab for induction of clinical remission in bio-
logic-naïve patients (evidence was rated down owing to
imprecision caused by a low event rate) (Table 2). On
comparison of active interventions, there was moderate
conﬁdence in estimates supporting the use of inﬂiximab
over adalimumab (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.16–3.79); none of
the other comparisons between active interventions
were signiﬁcantly different (Table 2). Overall, inﬂiximab
(SUCRA, 0.95) was ranked highest for inducing clinical
remission

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis
