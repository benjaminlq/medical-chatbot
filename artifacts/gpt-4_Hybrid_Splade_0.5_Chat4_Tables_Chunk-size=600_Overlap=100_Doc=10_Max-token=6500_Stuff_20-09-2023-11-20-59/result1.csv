Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and has been previously exposed to infliximab, but his condition is worsening despite compliance. Therefore, the patient is not new and has a prior response to infliximab.

Given this information, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient would be Ustekinumab and Tofacitinib. These drugs are ranked highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists like infliximab, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement.

1. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is effective in inducing remission in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists. It is also ranked highest for all endpoints in patients exposed to anti-TNF-α therapy.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Ustekinumab is that it may not be as effective as other drugs in patients who are biologic-naïve. Also, more trials of direct comparisons are needed to inform clinical decision-making with greater confidence.

2. Tofacitinib:
   - Advantages: Tofacitinib is also effective in inducing remission in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists. It is ranked highest across all endpoints, irrespective of whether patients had or had not been exposed to anti-TNF-α drugs.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Tofacitinib is that it may not be as effective as other drugs in patients who are biologic-naïve. More trials of direct comparisons are needed to inform clinical decision-making with greater confidence.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential side effects of the drugs. It is also important to consider the cost and availability of these drugs.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is not new and has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis along with ankylosing spondylitis. There is no information provided about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, or prior failure to Vedolizumab. The patient's age is 56, and there is no information about pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis.

Given this information, the top two choices of biological drugs could be:

1. Infliximab: This is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that is used in the treatment of both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis.

Advantages: Infliximab can be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can also reduce signs and symptoms and induce and maintain clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ankylosing spondylitis.

Disadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects including infections (bacterial, viral, fungal), infusion reactions, and delayed hypersensitivity reactions. It may also increase the risk of developing lymphomas.

2. Adalimumab: This is another TNF-alpha inhibitor that is used in the treatment of both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis.

Advantages: Adalimumab can reduce signs and symptoms, induce major clinical response, inhibit the progression of structural damage, and improve physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. It can also induce and sustain clinical remission in adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to immunosuppressants.

Disadvantages: Adalimumab can have side effects including infections (bacterial, viral, fungal), injection site reactions, and may increase the risk of developing lymphomas.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health, other comorbidities, and personal preferences. The patient should be closely monitored for any side effects during the treatment.

   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also a good option for patients who have had prior exposure to TNF-alpha antagonists.

   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and can be used in patients who have had prior exposure to TNF-alpha antagonists. It works by blocking a specific protein (interleukin-12 and -23) involved in inflammation.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may increase the risk of infections. Common side effects include upper respiratory infections, headache, and fatigue. It may also not be as effective in patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy.

Given the patient's history of lymphoma, it is important to consider the potential risk of reactivation of malignancy with the use of immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, the choice of therapy should be individualized and discussed thoroughly with the patient.",Vedolizumab,,,Ustekinumab,,,"title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Adalimumab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets inflammation in the gut, reducing systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Vedolizumab is that it may take longer to work compared to other biologics. Some patients may not see improvement in symptoms for several weeks. Additionally, as with all biologics, there is a risk of serious infections.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is a TNF inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can be administered at home via subcutaneous injection, which may be more convenient for some patients.
   - Disadvantages: Adalimumab can cause serious side effects, including infections and malignancies. It may also cause injection site reactions.

It's important to note that the patient's multiple sclerosis should be taken into consideration when choosing a treatment, as some medications for ulcerative colitis can worsen MS symptoms. The patient should discuss these options with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment.",Vedolizumab,,,Adalimumab,,,"title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is not new and has a history of malignant melanoma. The patient's age is 39, which is within the adult range. There is no information provided about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis.

Given the patient's history of malignant melanoma, it is important to consider the potential risk of reactivation of malignancy when choosing a biological drug.

Here are two potential choices:

1. Vedolizumab

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, he has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and has previously been treated with infliximab but has developed a loss of response due to antibody formation. This suggests that he has had prior exposure to TNF antagonists and has failed to respond to infliximab.

Given this, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient would be:

1. Ustekinumab
2. Tofacitinib

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

Ustekinumab:
- Advantages: Ustekinumab has been ranked highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists for inducing remission and endoscopic improvement. It is also effective in patients who have failed to respond to anti-TNF agents.
- Disadvantages: The safety profile of ustekinumab is not as well established as other biologics. There is a risk of serious adverse events and infections.

Tofacitinib:
- Advantages: Tofacitinib is also ranked highly for inducing remission in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists. It is a small molecule drug and can be taken orally, which may be more convenient for some patients.
- Disadvantages: Tofacitinib has been associated with an increased risk of herpes zoster infection. It may also increase the risk of cardiovascular events and malignancies.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and preferences. It is also important to monitor the patient closely for any side effects or complications from the treatment.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Tofacitinib.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a first-line therapy for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and improving endoscopic outcomes.
   - Disadvantages: However, the patient may develop a secondary loss of response or immunogenicity to Infliximab. Also, as the patient has previously lost response to anti-TNF agents, there might be a lower chance of response to Infliximab, which is also an anti-TNF agent.

2. Tofacitinib:
   - Advantages: Tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor and can be used in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists. It has been shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who have had prior exposure to TNF antagonists.
   - Disadvantages: The safety profile of Tofacitinib is still being studied, and it may have potential side effects including serious infections and malignancies.

Please note that the choice of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition, preferences, and potential side effects of the drugs.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,"

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, she is a 42-year-old woman with moderate ulcerative colitis who is not responding to azathioprine therapy. She is not a new patient but under maintenance. There is no information about her prior response to Infliximab, Anti-TNF agents, or Vedolizumab. Her age is not a contraindication for any treatment. There is no information about pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis.

Given this, the top two choices of biological drugs for her could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also beneficial for patients who are refractory to conventional therapies like azathioprine.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects including infections, allergic reactions, and liver damage. It also requires intravenous administration which can be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets the gut and spares the rest of the body from immunosuppression. This can potentially lead to fewer side effects compared to other systemic immunosuppressants.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to work compared to other biologics. It also requires intravenous administration.

Please note that the choice of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and preferences, and in consultation with a gastroenterologist.

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, she is an adult with severe ulcerative colitis and a rare fistulating disease. She is not a new patient and her age is not a contraindication for any of the biologic therapies. However, the presence of a fistulating disease may influence the choice of therapy.

Here are two potential choices of biological drugs for this patient:

1. Infliximab
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating severe ulcerative colitis. It is also particularly effective in treating fistulating diseases, which is a rare complication of ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects, including infections, heart failure, and potentially serious allergic reactions. It also requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Adalimumab
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is another TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating severe ulcerative colitis. It is also used to treat fistulating diseases. Unlike infliximab, adalimumab is administered via subcutaneous injection, which some patients may find more convenient.
   - Disadvantages: Adalimumab can also cause serious side effects, including infections, heart failure, and potentially serious allergic reactions. Some patients may also find the need for regular injections to be inconvenient.

Please note that the choice of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, including her overall health, the severity of her disease, and her personal preferences. It is also important to monitor the patient closely for any side effects of these medications.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is an older adult with a history of prostate cancer and currently has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The patient has not been mentioned to have any prior exposure to any specific treatments for ulcerative colitis.

Given this, two potential biological drugs that could be considered are Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been found to be highly effective in inducing remission in biologic-naïve patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered intravenously and has a relatively quick onset of action.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects including increased risk of infections, potential for infusion reactions, and the development of antibodies against the drug which can decrease its effectiveness over time. Given the patient's age and history of cancer, there may be an increased risk of serious infections and potential malignancies.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. This could be beneficial for this patient given his age and history of cancer.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to show effects compared to other biologics. It also carries risks of side effects such as headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever. The risk of serious infections is also present, though potentially lower than with non-gut-selective biologics.

It's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health status, comorbidities, and preferences. The patient's oncologist should also be consulted given the history of prostate cancer.

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Infliximab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets inflammation in the gut, reducing systemic side effects. It has been shown to be safe and effective for the bowel disease in patients with concurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
   - Disadvantages: However, Vedolizumab does not improve liver biochemistry. This could be a significant disadvantage for this patient, given his decompensated cirrhosis.

2. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist, which can help reduce inflammation in the gut. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is a systemic immunosuppressant, which means it can have side effects throughout the body. This could potentially exacerbate the patient's existing liver condition. Additionally, it may not be as effective in patients who have previously been exposed to TNF antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is an adult with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who is seeking a rapid response to treatment. The patient's age and gender do not indicate any specific contraindications to any of the biologic therapies. However, the patient's preference for a rapid response to treatment is a significant factor in choosing the appropriate therapy.

Given this, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered intravenously, which allows for rapid onset of action.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects, including infections, lymphoma, and other cancers. It can also cause infusion reactions, which can include symptoms such as fever, chills, chest pain, low blood pressure, or shortness of breath.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist, which means it specifically targets the gut and is less likely to cause systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is also administered intravenously, which may not be convenient for all patients. It may take longer to work than some other treatments, which may not be ideal for patients who prioritize a rapid response to treatment. It can also cause side effects such as headache, joint pain, nausea, or fever.

Please note that the choice of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and preferences, and the potential risks and benefits of each treatment option should be discussed with the patient.",Infliximab,,,Vedolizumab,,,"title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is a new patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and extraintestinal manifestation (pyoderma gangrenosum). Considering the patient's age and condition, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Adalimumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also beneficial for patients with extraintestinal manifestations like pyoderma gangrenosum.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects including infections (like tuberculosis), lymphoma, and other cancers. Patients may also develop antibodies to infliximab which can decrease its effectiveness.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is also effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and can be used in patients with extraintestinal manifestations. It is administered subcutaneously and may be more convenient for some patients.
   - Disadvantages: Similar to Infliximab, Adalimumab can cause serious infections and increase the risk of certain types of cancer. It may also cause injection site reactions.

It's important to discuss these options with the patient, considering the potential benefits and risks of each treatment. The patient's preferences and lifestyle should also be taken into account when making a decision.",Infliximab,,,Adalimumab,,,"title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

There is no information provided about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, or prior failure to Vedolizumab. The patient is 58 years old, not pregnant, and has extraintestinal manifestations (optic neuritis). There is no information about pouchitis.

Given this information, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Some patients may not respond to Vedolizumab. Side effects can include headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever. Serious side effects can include infections and liver problems.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and has a good safety profile. It is also beneficial for patients with extraintestinal manifestations, such as optic neuritis.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab requires initial intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient. Side effects can include upper respiratory infections, fatigue, and headache. There is also a risk of serious infections and cancer.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential for side effects. The patient should be closely monitored during treatment for any side effects or signs of infection.

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is not new and has a history of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis with colonic polyps and high-grade dysplasia. However, the patient's prior response to Infliximab, Anti-TNF agents, and Vedolizumab is not mentioned.

Given the patient's age and disease severity, two potential biological drugs could be considered: Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can also help to heal the lining of the intestine, reducing the risk of complications.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects, including infections (such as tuberculosis), heart failure, liver damage, and an increased risk of lymphoma. It also requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist, which means it specifically targets the gut and is less likely to cause systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab can cause side effects such as headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever. It also requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient for some patients. In addition, its effectiveness in patients with a history of high-grade dysplasia is not well studied.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health, disease severity, and personal preferences.

The patient's age and the presence of extraintestinal manifestations (alopecia areata) are considered. However, information about prior treatments or responses to specific drugs is not provided.

Given the available information, two potential biological drugs for treatment could be:

1. Infliximab
2. Adalimumab

Infliximab:
Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered intravenously, which allows for dosage adjustments and monitoring of patient response during administration.
Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects, including infections (such as tuberculosis), heart failure, and liver damage. It may also cause or worsen psoriasis, another autoimmune condition, which could potentially exacerbate the patient's alopecia areata.

Adalimumab:
Advantages: Adalimumab is another TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered via subcutaneous injection, which may be more convenient for some patients.
Disadvantages: Like infliximab, adalimumab can cause serious side effects, including infections, heart failure, and liver damage. It may also cause or worsen psoriasis and could potentially exacerbate the patient's alopecia areata.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Vedolizumab is that it may take longer to work compared to other biologics. It also requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who have had prior exposure to TNF antagonists. It is also administered subcutaneously, which some patients may find more convenient.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may increase the risk of infections, including reactivation of tuberculosis. Given the patient's history of pulmonary tuberculosis, this risk would need to be carefully considered and the patient closely monitored.

It's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized, taking into account the patient's specific circumstances, preferences, and potential risks. The patient should also be closely monitored for any signs of infection, given her history of tuberculosis.
