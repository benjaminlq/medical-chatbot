The patient has not been mentioned to have any prior exposure to any specific treatments for ulcerative colitis. \n\nGiven this, two potential biological drugs that could be considered are Infliximab and Vedolizumab. \n\n1. Infliximab:\n   - Advantages: Infliximab has been found to be highly effective in inducing remission in biologic-na\u00efve patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered intravenously and has a relatively quick onset of action.\n   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects including increased risk of infections, potential for infusion reactions, and the development of antibodies against the drug which can decrease its effectiveness over time. Given the patient's age and history of cancer, there may be an increased risk of serious infections and potential malignancies.\n\n2. Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. This could be beneficial for this patient given his age and history of cancer.\n   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to show effects compared to other biologics. It also carries risks of side effects such as headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever. The risk of serious infections is also present, though potentially lower than with non-gut-selective biologics.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health status, comorbidities, and preferences.
