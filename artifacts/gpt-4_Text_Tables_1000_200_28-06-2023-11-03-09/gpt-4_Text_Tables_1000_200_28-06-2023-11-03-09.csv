Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title:

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis
