Vedolizumab\n2. Ustekinumab\n\nHere are the pros and cons of these two choices:\n\nVedolizumab:\n- Advantages: Vedolizumab is an anti-integrin antibody that has been shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. It has a different mechanism of action from anti-TNF agents, so it may be effective in patients who have failed to respond to these agents. Additionally, it has been ranked as the safest drug in terms of adverse events and serious adverse events.\n- Disadvantages: The efficacy of Vedolizumab may be lower than some other agents, such as Infliximab. It may also take longer to work than anti-TNF agents.\n\nUstekinumab:\n- Advantages: Ustekinumab is an anti-interleukin-12/23 antibody that has been shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Like Vedolizumab, it has a different mechanism of action from anti-TNF agents, so it may be effective in patients who have failed to respond to these agents.\n- Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may be less effective than some other agents, such as Infliximab. There may also be a higher risk of infection with Ustekinumab compared to other agents.\n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, including their overall health, the severity of their disease, and their personal preferences. It's also important to consider the potential for adverse effects and drug interactions. The patient should be closely monitored while on these medications to ensure that they are effective and well-tolerated. \n\n[{\"drug_name\": \"Vedolizumab\", \"advantages\": \"Effective in inducing clinical remission, different mechanism of action from anti-TNF agents, ranked as the safest drug in terms of adverse events and serious adverse events\", \"disadvantages\": \"Lower efficacy than some other agents, may take longer to work than anti-TNF agents\"}, {\"drug_name\": \"Ustekinumab\", \"advantages\": \"Effective in inducing clinical remission, different mechanism of action from anti-TNF agents\", \"disadvantages\": \"Less effective than some other agents, higher risk of infection\"}]", "sources": [{"title": "Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf", "page": 4.0, "text": "of bias for most of the included studies (appendix p 5). \nConfidence in the estimates derived from our meta-\nanalysis is shown in the appendix (pp 6\u20138).\nA network map of induction trials assessing clinical \nremission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative \ncolitis is shown in figure 2.

It may still be effective in patients who have lost response to other anti-TNF agents.\n   - Disadvantages: The patient has already lost response to anti-TNF agents, which may suggest that she might not respond well to Infliximab.

It can be used in patients who have not responded to conventional therapy.\n   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects including infections (such as tuberculosis), lymphoma, and other malignancies. Patients need to be screened for TB before starting treatment. It can also cause infusion reactions and autoimmune responses.\n\n2. Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and spares the rest of the body from immunosuppression. This can result in fewer systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.\n   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab can cause side effects such as headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever.

It has a strong effect size for inducing clinical remission, making it a potent choice for patients who have lost response to other treatments.\n   - Disadvantages: Infliximab, like other biologics, can have side effects including risk of serious infections. Some patients may also develop anti-drug antibodies to Infliximab, reducing its effectiveness over time.\n\n2.

It is also effective in inducing endoscopic improvement.\n   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Ustekinumab is that it may not be as potent as Infliximab in inducing clinical remission. Additionally, as with all biologics, there is a risk of side effects, including serious infections.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, including her overall health, lifestyle, and personal preferences.
