In the case of a 40-year-old male with newly diagnosed moderate UC and articular extraintestinal manifestations, early diagnosis and prompt institution of treatment are crucial for improving outcomes and maximizing health. Risk stratification of disease severity, based on clinical, demographic, and serologic markers, can help guide the selection of first-line therapy. The armamentarium of IBD medications is growing, and the selection of first-line therapy is critical. Biological drugs, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) like adalimumab (ADA) or infliximab (IFX), may be considered as first-line therapy for moderate to severe UC. These medications have shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in UC patients and can also help manage extraintestinal manifestations. However, it is important to consider individual patient factors, preferences, and potential risks and benefits when selecting a specific biological drug. Close monitoring of disease activity and response to treatment using objective biomarkers, such as fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), is essential for optimizing therapy and ensuring long-term control of inflammation.

Other complications include anemia, nutritional deficiencies, loss of bone density, and progressive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inflammation is associated with growth impairment, risking permanent loss of height.\n\nThe recommended treat-to-target approach aims to achieve endoscopic healing and control of inflammation and involves early, aggressive treatment in appropriate patients. Delay in diagnosis can lead to adverse outcomes, and there is evidence of disease activity before diagnosis.

This study showed similar ef\ufb01cacy between the 2 groups at week 52: 65% in the ustekinumab group (n124/N191) vs. 61% in the adalimumab (n119/N195), p \u00bc 0.47. Interestingly, the rapidity of response was also similar between the two groups. The subanalyses re- ported a trend toward more safety, less use of concomitant steroids and a slightly better endoscopic response (particularly in patients with higher endoscopic scores at baseline) in the ustekinumab group.\"\n\n\"Additional head to head trials have been conducted in the etrolizu- mab study program (GARDENIA vs. in\ufb02iximab (Danese et al., 2021) and HIBISCUS vs. adalimumab (Rubin et al., 2021)) and Guselkumab phase II study (GALAXY vs. Ustekinumab (Sandborn et al., 2022)) which were presented at the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) conference in 2020. These studies didn't show signi\ufb01cant differences in the primary endpoints. More head to head trials are certainly under way and will help us better position biological agents and small molecules in the treatment algorithm (Pouillon et al., 2020).\"\n\n\"When no head to head trials are available, network meta-analysis are used to compare ef\ufb01cacy of biologics agents against placebo.\"\n\n\"One of the \ufb01rst meta-analyses, published in 2015, focused on the ef\ufb01cacy of \ufb01rst line biological therapy in UC (Danese et al., 2014). The authors suggested that in na\u00efve UC patients in\ufb02iximab and vedolizumab are more effective in inducing clinical response (Odd ratios (OR) 5.33 and 4.51, resp.) and maintaining remission (OR 2.78 and 5.19 resp.) compared to other regimens. These observations were con\ufb01rmed in the most recent meta-analysis from the same group (Bonovas et al., 2018) and another analysis that included ustekinumab (Singh et al., 2018a). This latter meta-analysis reported some bene\ufb01t of ustekinumab over adalimumab or vedolizumab after anti-TNF exposure in UC patients.\"", "In CD, a meta-analysis of 9 randomized trials with mixed \ufb01rst-line and second line indications con\ufb01rmed the superiority of in\ufb02iximab alone for induction (OR 2.8) or in combination with azathioprine for maintenance of remission (OR 3.0) (Hazlewood et al., 2015). A recent pooled analysis of 4 clinical trial programs (EXTEND, UNITY, VERSIFY, CPT-13 BIO-SIMILAR) was presented at ECCO congress 2022 and con\ufb01rmed that in\ufb02iximab achieved a higher proportion of 1-year endoscopic healing compared to adalimumab, ustekinumab and vedolizumab in CD patients, but not in bio-na\u00efve patients (Narula et al., 2022).\n\nAs second line therapy, it is also important to consider that the ef\ufb01cacy of vedolizumab will be in\ufb02uenced by previous anti-TNF exposure, a numerical difference was seen in the response to therapy in UC (Feagan et al., 2017) and CD patients (Sands et al., 2017). An impact which was clearly signi\ufb01cant at week 6 after induction (Sands et al., 2014).\n\nIn summary, the most recent meta-analysis in CD which included ustekinumab concluded that in\ufb02iximab or adalimumab are the best \ufb01rst-line agents, and ustekinumab a preferred second-line agent in patients with prior anti-TNF alpha agents\u2019 exposure (Singh et al., 2018b).\n\nThe conclusion was that in biologic-na\u00efve patients with moderate to severely active CD, in\ufb02iximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab are the most effective compared to vedolizumab and certolizumab pegol. In\ufb02iximab was considered the strongest for induction. However, in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to in\ufb02iximab), the bene\ufb01t of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain.", "The text relevant to the treatment of a patient with moderate UC using biological drugs is as follows:\n\n\"In patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to in\ufb02iximab), the bene\ufb01t of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain. A summary of the ef\ufb01cacies of the various biological agents, according to the line of treatment and previous treatment failures and patients' phenotype, is provided in Table 2. The \ufb01nal word about the ef\ufb01cacy of biologics in IBD and the theoretical \u201ctherapeutic ceiling\u201d which cannot be broken (Alsoud et al., 2021) could potentially come from combining these agents such as demonstrated by the recent VEGA study. This 3-arm trial presented as one of the highlights of the recent ECCO congress 2022, compared golimumab (GOL), guselkumab (GUS) and their combined use during induction period of 12 weeks. This showed a signi\ufb01cant higher rate of clinical response (83% for combination therapy vs. 75% for GUS (p \u00bc 0.215) and 61% for GOL (p \u00bc 0.003)) and clinical remission (47% for combination therapy vs. 24% for GUS (p \u00bc 0.005) and 25% for GOL (p \u00bc 0.007) based on modi\ufb01ed Mayo score) without added risks for safety in moderate to severely active UC patients na\u00efve to biologics (Sands et al., 2022).\"\n\nThis text discusses the efficacy of different biological agents in the treatment of UC, including the potential benefit of combining agents. It also mentions a recent study comparing golimumab and guselkumab, as well as their combined use, in UC patients.", "There is relevant information in the document for the treatment of a patient with moderate UC using biological drugs. Here are the relevant excerpts:\n\n\"A pooled analysis of data from four randomized trials including 2257 UC patients reported that older patients have an increased baseline risk of adverse effects not related to anti-TNF therapy. In older IBD patients, a protective effect against the development of severe adverse events have been demonstrated in UC (OR 0.54 (0.35\u20130.83, p < 0.01) but not CD (OR 1.3 (0.8\u20131.20)) when administering vedolizumab compared to anti-TNF agents (Cheng et al., 2021). Earlier publications, also suggested a very good safety of anti-TNF agents in older populations (Bonovas et al., 2016). At this stage, we can thus consider all biological agents, when indicated, as safe in all populations.\"\n\n\"In some large clinical trials, initiation of biologic therapy at a younger age was associated with better response, for example in\ufb02iximab in both CD and UC patients (Vermeire et al., 2002; Billiet et al., 2015). However, other studies, (particularly in long term follow-up of patients cohorts), did not \ufb01nd such an association as well as no differences in response according to gender (Ferrante et al., 2008; Sprakes et al., 2012; Arias et al., 2015; Iborra et al., 2017). Although much fewer studies are available, remission rates observed with vedolizumab in elderly and pediatric population appear to match those reported in the general adult population (Asscher et al., 2020; Ibraheim et al., 2020). The same observations were also made for ustekinumab (Asscher et al., 2020; Conrad and Kelsen, 2020; Gisbert and Chaparro, 2020).\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, biological agents such as vedolizumab or ustekinumab can be considered as safe and effective treatment options for the patient with moderate UC.", "Only limited data are available regarding the use of biological agents in the treatment of isolated proctitis in UC patients. In a national retrospective study in France, half of 104 patients with ulcerative proctitis achieved remission with various anti-TNF therapies and 60% achieved mucosal healing (Pineton de Chambrun et al., 2020). This suggests that biological therapy may be effective in treating UC patients with isolated proctitis.\n\nIt is important to consider the duration of disease when determining the appropriate treatment approach. Shorter disease duration has been associated with better response to biological therapies, including anti-TNF agents (Hyams et al., 2007; Walters et al., 2014; Colombel et al., 2007; Schreiber et al., 2010). However, the association between disease duration and response to biological therapy may vary between UC and CD patients. A retrospective analysis of the Swiss IBD cohort showed an impact of disease duration on response in UC but not in CD patients (Mader et al., 2021).\n\nIn terms of extraintestinal manifestations, there is limited information specifically related to articular manifestations in UC patients. However, studies have investigated the effect of biological agents on sarcopenia, which is a common extraintestinal manifestation in IBD patients. One study reported an improvement in muscle volume and strength in CD patients after treatment with infliximab (Subramaniam et al., 2015). Another study observed an improvement in fat-free mass index in UC and CD patients on anti-TNF agents (Csontos et al., 2016). While these studies do not directly address articular manifestations, they suggest that biological therapy may have positive effects on extraintestinal manifestations in general.\n\nOverall, the use of biological agents in the treatment of moderate UC with articular extraintestinal manifestations may be considered, particularly in patients with shorter disease duration. However, further research is needed to specifically evaluate the efficacy of biological therapy in UC patients with articular manifestations.", "Vedolizumab may not be the most appropriate biologic for the treatment of articular manifestations in patients with UC. This is because vedolizumab, which binds to \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, may not impede the entry of proinflammatory cells into the joints and may even contribute to a higher influx of these cells to distant sites. In fact, studies have observed de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated IBD patients. Additionally, an increased incidence of extraintestinal manifestations has been observed in vedolizumab-treated IBD patients compared to anti-TNF agents. However, anti-TNF agents, such as infliximab, have been shown to be effective in treating rheumatological manifestations in both CD and UC patients. Therefore, anti-TNF agents may be a better treatment choice for UC patients with articular extraintestinal manifestations.", "The provided text does not contain any relevant information for the treatment of a patient with moderate UC and articular extraintestinal manifestations using biological drugs.", "Bonovas, S., Lytras, T., Nikolopoulos, G., Peyrin-Biroulet, L., Danese, S., 2018.

It is associated with significant morbidity and impaired quality of life. The goals of treatment in UC are to induce and maintain remission, improve symptoms, and prevent complications. Conventional therapies, such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators, are often used as first-line treatments. However, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to or cannot tolerate these therapies. In recent years, biological therapies and small molecules have emerged as alternative treatment options for moderate to severe UC. Biological therapies target specific molecules involved in the inflammatory process, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or integrins, while small molecules inhibit intracellular signaling pathways. These treatments have shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in UC, but there is limited evidence comparing their efficacy.\"\n\n\"Results\nStudy selection\nA total of 25 RCTs involving 6,789 patients were included in the analysis. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1. The majority of the studies evaluated the efficacy of anti-TNF agents, such as infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab. Other biological therapies included vedolizumab and ustekinumab. Small molecules evaluated in the studies included tofacitinib and upadacitinib.\"\n\n\"Efficacy outcomes\nThe primary outcome of the network meta-analysis was clinical remission at 52 weeks. The results showed that biological therapies, including anti-TNF agents and vedolizumab, were more effective than placebo in achieving clinical remission. The relative risk (RR) of achieving clinical remission with anti-TNF agents compared to placebo was 2.34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-2.89), while the RR for vedolizumab compared to placebo was 2.12 (95% CI 1.61-2.79). Small molecules, such as tofacitinib and upadacitinib, also showed efficacy in achieving clinical remission. The RR for tofacitinib compared to placebo was 2.18 (95% CI 1.68-2.83), and the RR for upadacitinib compared to placebo was 2.05 (95% CI 1.57-2.68).\"\n\n\"Adverse events\nThe rates of adverse events varied among the different treatments. The most common adverse events reported were infections, infusion reactions, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The rates of serious adverse events were generally low, but there were differences among the treatments. For example, the rate of serious adverse events with anti-TNF agents ranged from 0% to 7%, while the rate with vedolizumab ranged from 0% to 3%. The rates of serious adverse events with small molecules ranged from 0% to 4% for tofacitinib and from 0% to 2% for upadacitinib.\"\n\n\"Discussion\nIn this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we evaluated the efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe UC.

Small molecules, such as tofacitinib and upadacitinib, also showed efficacy in achieving clinical remission.

The first is vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the homing receptor \u03b14\u03b27 integrin complex, blocking the interaction of the surface homing molecules of activated immune cells with the endothelium to reduce diapedesis. The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These new agents have now proved their efficacy not only against placebo but also in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in specific indications (Sands et al., 2019, 2021; Irving et al., 2021). Consequently, they possess a comfortable market position compared to the historical anti-TNF agents, when not surpassing them for certain targeted groups of patients. However, striking efficacy differences have not been shown to support their superiority and anti-TNF agents remain the most appropriate medications in presence of most concomitant extraintestinal manifestations or in fistulizing CD (Juillerat et al., 2020; Papamichael et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021).\"\n\nBased on this information, vedolizumab and ustekinumab are two potential biological drugs that can be considered for the treatment of severe UC. However, it is important to note that anti-TNF agents, such as infliximab and adalimumab, are still considered the most appropriate medications for certain groups of patients with concomitant extraintestinal manifestations or fistulizing CD. The decision on which biological drug to use should be based on the individual patient's characteristics, safety profile, and specific indications.", "Unfortunately, the provided portion of the document does not contain any relevant information about the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs for a 70-year-old female patient.", "The relevant text for the treatment of a patient with newly diagnosed severe UC using biological drugs is as follows:\n\n\"The biological agents available for IBD treatment and their individual characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\"\n\n\"The \ufb01rst head to head published was the VARSITY trial (Sands et al., 2019).

At week 52 the clinical remission rate (31.3% vs. 22.5%; P \u00bc 0.006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs. 27.7%; P < 0.001) was signi\ufb01cantly higher with vedolizumab compared to adalimumab.

Interestingly, the rapidity of response was also similar between the two groups. The subanalyses re-ported a trend toward more safety, less use of concomitant steroids and a slightly better endoscopic response (particularly in patients with higher endoscopic scores at baseline) in the ustekinumab group.\"\n\nThese findings suggest that vedolizumab may be more effective than adalimumab in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in UC patients, while ustekinumab and adalimumab have similar efficacy in CD patients.

(Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019) when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have occurred.\"\n- \"The decision on drug selection in clinical practice is often guided by disease severity that requires ef\ufb01cacious treatment with rapid onset of action, an acceptable safety pro\ufb01le balanced against potential adverse effects, in particular when the decision results in the use of high dose of corticosteroids (Ford et al., 2011).\"", "A pooled analysis of data from four randomized trials including 2257 UC patients reported that older patients have an increased baseline risk of adverse effects not related to anti-TNF therapy. In older IBD patients, a protective effect against the development of severe adverse events have been demonstrated in UC when administering vedolizumab compared to anti-TNF agents. Earlier publications also suggested a very good safety of anti-TNF agents in older populations. At this stage, we can thus consider all biological agents, when indicated, as safe in all populations.", "Only limited data are available regarding the use of biological agents in the treatment of isolated proctitis in UC patients. In a national retrospective study in France, half of 104 patients with ulcerative proctitis achieved remission with various anti-TNF therapies and 60% achieved mucosal healing (Pineton de Chambrun et al., 2020).

An increased incidence of extraintestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also been observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims database (Dubinsky et al., 2018).

Upadacitinib 45mg o.d. also ranked first in patients who were anti-TNF-\u03b1 na\u00efve. In terms of endoscopic improvement, infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by upadacitinib 45mg o.d. However, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapies and in patients who were anti-TNF-\u03b1 na\u00efve. \n\nIt is important to note that the certainty in the quality of evidence for these findings would be high. However, it is also important to consider the limitations of the included studies, such as the possibility that trials of newer drugs included patients with refractory UC who had failed multiple other therapies.", "Based on the given patient profile, the relevant information from the document is as follows:\n\n\"Few trials reported efficacy according to concomitant immunomodulator use, and the earlier trials of infliximab excluded such patients. Given combination therapy has been shown to be superior to either monotherapy in one trial, this may have underestimated efficacy of some drugs.\"\n\nThis information suggests that the patient's prior exposure to infliximab, without concomitant use of an immunomodulator, may have underestimated the efficacy of the drug. It implies that combination therapy with an immunomodulator may be more effective in treating the patient's worsening colitis.", "In patients exposed to biological therapies, tofacitinib ranked first for both clinical remission and endoscopic improvement. This suggests that tofacitinib may be a potential treatment option for your patient with moderate UC who has prior exposure to infliximab but is experiencing worsening colitis on endoscopy. It is important to discuss this option with the patient's healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan.", "In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, the efficacy of various biological therapies and small molecules for the induction of remission in moderate to severe UC was evaluated. Among the biological therapies, infliximab ranked highest for all endpoints in all patients, including those who were na\u00efve to anti-TNF-\u03b1 drugs. However, in patients exposed to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy, ustekinumab ranked highest for all endpoints. \n\nIt is important to note that the number of patients in the RCTs of upadacitinib, a small molecule, is comparable to the trials of infliximab. Upadacitinib ranked highest across all endpoints, regardless of whether patients had or had not been exposed to anti-TNF-\u03b1 drugs, and was even ranked above infliximab in most analyses.\n\nConsidering the patient's prior exposure to infliximab and worsening colitis on endoscopy, it may be worth considering ustekinumab or upadacitinib as potential treatment options. However, individual drug therapy should be guided by patient choice, taking into account factors such as route of administration, tolerability, and costs. It is also important to note that the safety profile of all drugs included in the analysis was generally favorable, with the exception of a higher risk of infection associated with tofacitinib compared to placebo and vedolizumab.", "The text relevant to the treatment of a patient with moderate UC who has prior exposure to infliximab and worsening colitis on endoscopy despite compliance is as follows:\n\n\"More recently, two additional biologicals, with different mechanisms of action, have complemented the IBD armamentarium. The first is vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the homing receptor \u03b14\u03b27 integrin complex, blocking the interaction of the surface homing molecules of activated immune cells with the endothelium to reduce diapedesis. The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These new agents have now proved their efficacy not only against placebo but also in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in specific indications (Sands et al., 2019, 2021; Irving et al., 2021). Consequently, they possess a comfortable market position compared to the historical anti-TNF agents, when not surpassing them for certain targeted groups of patients. However, striking efficacy differences have not been shown to support their superiority and anti-TNF agents remain the most appropriate medications in presence of most concomitant extraintestinal manifestations or in fistulizing CD (Juillerat et al., 2020; Papamichael et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021).\"\n\nBased on this information, vedolizumab and ustekinumab may be considered as treatment options for this patient with moderate UC who has worsening colitis despite prior exposure to infliximab. It is important to discuss these options with the patient and consider factors such as efficacy, safety profile, and specific indications before making a decision.", "Unfortunately, the provided portion of the document does not contain any relevant information about the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs for a patient with prior exposure to infliximab.", "The relevant text for the treatment of the given patient profile using biological drugs is as follows:\n\n\"The SEAVUE study compared ustekinumab with adalimumab in 386 bio-na\u00efve patients with moderate to severe CD over 52 weeks. Participants were required to discontinue immunomodulators prior to initiation. This study showed similar ef\ufb01cacy between the 2 groups at week 52: 65% in the ustekinumab group (n124/N191) vs. 61% in the adalimumab (n119/N195), p \u00bc 0.47. Interestingly, the rapidity of response was also similar between the two groups. The subanalyses re- ported a trend toward more safety, less use of concomitant steroids and a slightly better endoscopic response (particularly in patients with higher endoscopic scores at baseline) in the ustekinumab group.\"\n\nThis information suggests that ustekinumab may be a suitable option for the patient, as it has shown similar efficacy to adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Additionally, ustekinumab may provide a slightly better endoscopic response, which could be beneficial for the patient who has worsening colitis on endoscopy. However, further evaluation and discussion with a healthcare provider is necessary to determine the most appropriate treatment option for the patient.", "In CD, a meta-analysis of 9 randomized trials with mixed \ufb01rst-line and second line indications con\ufb01rmed the superiority of in\ufb02iximab alone for induction (OR 2.8) or in combination with azathioprine for maintenance of remission (OR 3.0) (Hazlewood et al., 2015). A recent pooled analysis of 4 clinical trial programs (EXTEND, UNITY, VERSIFY, CPT-13 BIO-SIMILAR) was presented at ECCO congress 2022 and con\ufb01rmed that in\ufb02iximab achieved a higher proportion of 1-year endoscopic healing compared to adalimumab, ustekinumab and vedolizumab in CD patients, but not in bio-na\u00efve patients (Narula et al., 2022).\n\nAs second line therapy, it is also important to consider that the ef\ufb01cacy of vedolizumab will be in\ufb02uenced by previous anti-TNF exposure, a numerical difference was seen in the response to therapy in UC (Feagan et al., 2017) and CD patients (Sands et al., 2017). An impact which was clearly signi\ufb01cant at week 6 after induction (Sands et al., 2014).\n\nIn the most recent publication from the American Gastroenterology Association: \u201cTechnical Review, the Medical Management of Moderate to Severe Luminal and Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease\u201d, the conclusion was that in biologic-na\u00efve patients with moderate to severely active CD, in\ufb02iximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab are the most effective compared to vedolizumab and certolizumab pegol. In\ufb02iximab was considered the strongest for induction. However, in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to in\ufb02iximab), the bene\ufb01t of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain.", "In patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to infliximab), the benefit of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain. A summary of the efficacies of the various biological agents, according to the line of treatment and previous treatment failures and patients' phenotype, is provided in Table 2. The decision on drug selection in clinical practice is often guided by disease severity that requires efficacious treatment with rapid onset of action, an acceptable safety profile balanced against potential adverse effects, in particular when the decision results in the use of high dose of corticosteroids. When the situation is less acute, depending on patient comorbidities, the safety profile of the biologic is one of the major factors influencing the decision.", "In some large clinical trials, initiation of biologic therapy at a younger age was associated with better response, for example infliximab in both CD and UC patients (Vermeire et al., 2002; Billiet et al., 2015). However, other studies, (particularly in long term follow-up of patients cohorts), did not find such an association as well as no differences in response according to gender (Ferrante et al., 2008; Sprakes et al., 2012; Arias et al., 2015; Iborra et al., 2017). Although much fewer studies are available, remission rates observed with vedolizumab in elderly and pediatric population appear to match those reported in the general adult population (Asscher et al., 2020; Ibraheim et al., 2020). The same observations were also made for ustekinumab (Asscher et al., 2020; Conrad and Kelsen, 2020; Gisbert and Chaparro, 2020).", "Only limited data are available regarding ustekinumab in early CD. In a retrospective pediatric cohort, treated with ustekinumab, the rate of remission was 61.1% in patients despite prior anti-TNF failure, suggesting a high potential with this agent in early disease (Kim et al., 2021).\n\nRegarding vedolizumab, a retrospective analysis of the Swiss IBD cohort showed an impact of disease duration on response in UC but not in CD patients (Mader et al., 2021).\n\nIn a large retrospective single center cohort, clinical response to biological therapy (mostly infliximab) was obtained in 70% of 118 5-ASA refractory ulcerative proctitis patients, as compared to 11% with azathioprine (Dubois et al., 2020).\n\nRecent studies have linked the risk of antibody development against biologic therapies, in particular anti-TNF agents, to the HLA profile of patients (Sazonovs et al., 2020, 2021). The authors associated the carriage of the HLA-DQA1*05 allele, common to 40% of Europeans, with a higher rate of immunogenicity to infliximab and adalimumab. Although details of the evidence have been discussed, the same association was found in the ABIRISK consortium in autoimmune diseases (Hassler et al., 2020). Whether information on HLA allele carriage can be used prospectively to identify patients at risk of developing antibodies for a specific prospective intervention remains to be seen.", "The relevant text for the given patient profile is:\n\n\"Since their approval in IBD, in\ufb02iximab and later the other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD patient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials in both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established ef\ufb01cacies in most rheumatological indications (Herfarth et al., 2002; Generini et al., 2004; Lofberg et al., 2012; Louis et al., 2018).\"\n\n\"Best results so far are obtained with anti-TNF agents. Among them, only in\ufb02iximab has been evaluated in a large, dedicated placebo-randomized trial. Out of 366 patients who received induction with 5 mg/kg in\ufb02iximab at Week 0, 2 and 6, 195 responders were randomized to maintenance therapy or placebo. At Week 54, 36% of in\ufb02iximab treated patients had a complete absence of \ufb01stula against 19% in the placebo group (Sands et al., 2004). Regarding the other bi- ologicals, subanalyses of randomized trials showed effectiveness of adalimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab in \ufb01stula closure, however the patient numbers are limited. All the data regarding these studies are put in perspective in the previously cited AGA Technical Review (Singh et al., 2021).\"\n\nBased on this information, it is relevant to consider using anti-TNF agents, such as infliximab or adalimumab, for the treatment of the patient's moderate UC and worsening colitis.

Personalizing IBD treatment depends on previous drug exposure IBD (1st, 2nd, 3rd line of treatment), prior treatment response, comorbidities, safety profile, patient preferences and patient risk for future IBD complications (disease severity).

At the other end of the spectrum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD. With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate severity and 10%\u201315% of patients can experience a severe course. In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these, disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis. The risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6% 10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased significantly during the last 6 decades. The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and waning, but the underlying systemic inflammation can lead to progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinal damage and risk of complications if not treated adequately. Complications associated with ongoing inflammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, fistulas, abscesses, and surgery, and those associated with UC include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and colorectal cancer. Other complications include anemia, nutritional deficiencies, loss of bone density, and progressive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inflammation is associated with growth impairment, risking permanent loss of height. The concordance between intestinal inflammation and symptoms can be limited, especially in CD. In a population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inflammation may precede formal diagnosis. The STRIDE (Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant to target endoscopic healing, minimize disability, and restore quality of life and adequate growth in children, in addition to control of symptoms. Therefore, rather than a gradual \"step-up\" approach, in which treatment adjustment is based on the severity of symptoms, the recommended treat-to-target approach aims to achieve endoscopic healing and control of inflammation and involves early, aggressive treatment in appropriate patients. Delay in diagnosis is more common in CD than UC. Data from the Swiss IBD cohort demonstrate that CD diagnosis can be delayed in pediatric and adult patients by 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Adults were more likely to present with strictures and require bowel surgery. Furthermore, the duration of diagnostic delay has been associated with complications such as strictures and internal fistulae. There is a significant increase in gastrointestinal symptoms before IBD diagnosis. In addition, patients who were diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome or depression were less likely to receive timely specialist referral, suggesting that delays in IBD diagnosis may be related to focusing on comorbid or inaccurate diagnoses.

Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) are considered the mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe UC. In a network meta-analysis, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) were found to be superior to other therapies for moderate UC.

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared at least two interventions in patients with moderate to severe UC. The primary outcome was clinical remission at 8-12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic remission, mucosal healing, and adverse events. \nResults: A total of 20 RCTs involving 4,500 patients were included in the analysis. The network meta-analysis showed that biological therapies, including anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab), vedolizumab, and ustekinumab, were more effective than placebo in achieving clinical remission. Small molecules, such as tofacitinib and filgotinib, also showed efficacy in achieving clinical remission.

The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These new agents have now proved their efficacy not only against placebo but also in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in specific indications (Sands et al., 2019, 2021; Irving et al., 2021).

Personalizing IBD treatment depends on previous drug exposure IBD (1st, 2nd, 3rd line of treatment), prior treatment response, comorbidities, safety profile, patient preferences and patient risk for future IBD complications (disease severity). For example, primary non-response to an anti-TNF was found to be a predictor for diminished treatment efficacy with an anti-integrin biologic (Singh et al., 2018c).

However, data are even scarcer concerning the third line of treatment after two anti-TNFs exposure.\"\n\n\"There is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD patients. During anti-TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to responders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R, and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T cells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019) when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have occurred.\"\n\n\"The decision on drug selection in clinical practice is often guided by disease severity that requires efficacious treatment with rapid onset of action, an acceptable safety profile balanced against potential adverse effects, in particular when the decision results in the use of high dose of corticosteroids (Ford et al., 2011).

At this stage, we can thus consider all biological agents, when indicated, as safe in all populations.\"\n\n\"In some large clinical trials, initiation of biologic therapy at a younger age was associated with better response, for example in\ufb02iximab in both CD and UC patients (Vermeire et al., 2002; Billiet et al., 2015).

However, treatment limitations for moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs (SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immunogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are currently approved for use in adults with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally administered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their JAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and UPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 over JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA preferentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selectively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), is also approved for use in UC.10\"", "Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any relevant information about the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs for a patient with ankylosing spondylitis.", "The text provided does not contain any relevant information about the treatment of ulcerative colitis using biological drugs for a patient with ankylosing spondylitis.", "There is no relevant information in the provided text for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis using biological drugs.", "There is no relevant information in the given portion of the document for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis using biological drugs.", "Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any relevant information about the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs for a patient with ankylosing spondylitis.", "There is no relevant information in the provided text for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis using biological drugs.", "There is no relevant text in the provided portion of the document for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs for a patient with ankylosing spondylitis.", "There is no relevant text in the provided portion of the document for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis using biological drugs.", "There is no relevant information in the provided text for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis using biological drugs.", "There is no relevant information in the provided text regarding the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis.", "Unfortunately, the given portion of the document does not provide any relevant information specifically for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis using biological drugs.", "There is no relevant information in the given text about the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs for a patient with ankylosing spondylitis.", "There is no relevant information in the provided text for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis using biological drugs.", "There is no relevant information in the given text regarding the treatment of ulcerative colitis in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.", "There is no relevant information in the provided text for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis using biological drugs.", "There is no relevant information in the provided text for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis using biological drugs.", "There is no relevant information in the provided text for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis using biological drugs.", "There is no relevant information in the given text regarding the treatment of ulcerative colitis in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.", "The relevant text for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs is as follows:\n\n\"30 mg maintenance may be overall highest performing advanced treatment at inducing and maintaining clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic improvement in patients with moderately to severely active UC, regardless of prior biologic exposure.

Risk stratification of disease severity, based on clinical, demographic, and serologic markers, can help guide selection of first-line therapy. Clinical decision support tools, genomics, and other biomarkers of response to therapy and risk of adverse events are the future of personalized medicine. After starting appropriate therapy, it is important to confirm remission using objective end points (treat to target) with continued control of inflammation with adjustment of therapy using surrogate biomarkers (tight control). Lastly, IBD therapy extends far beyond medications, and other aspects of the overall health and wellbeing of the patient are critical. These include preventive health, nutrition, and psychobehavioral support addressing patients' concerns around complementary therapy and medication adherence, prevention of disability, and ensuring open communication.", "Unfortunately, the provided portion of the document does not contain any relevant information specifically related to the treatment of a patient with severe ulcerative colitis who has lost response to vedolizumab.", "In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia, stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal disease in 25% of patients. At the other end of the spectrum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.\n\nWith respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate severity and 10%\u201315% of patients can experience a severe course. In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these, disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.\n\nThe symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and waning, but the underlying systemic inflammation can lead to progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinal damage and risk of complications if not treated adequately. Complications associated with ongoing inflammation in UC include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and colorectal cancer. Other complications include anemia, nutritional deficiencies, loss of bone density, and progressive loss of quality of life.\n\nThe concordance between intestinal inflammation and symptoms can be limited, especially in CD. In a population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inflammation may precede formal diagnosis. The STRIDE (Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant to target endoscopic healing, minimize disability, and restore quality of life and adequate growth in children, in addition to control of symptoms. Therefore, rather than a gradual \"step-up\" approach, in which treatment adjustment is based on the severity of symptoms, the recommended treat-to-target approach aims to achieve endoscopic healing and control of inflammation and involves early, aggressive treatment in appropriate patients.\n\nDelay in diagnosis is more common in CD than UC. Data from the Swiss IBD cohort demonstrate that CD diagnosis can be delayed in pediatric and adult patients by 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Adults were more likely to present with strictures and require bowel surgery. Furthermore, the duration of diagnostic delay has been associated with complications such as strictures and internal fistulae.\n\nThere is a significant increase in gastrointestinal symptoms before IBD diagnosis. In addition, patients who were diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome or depression were less likely to receive timely specialist referral, suggesting that delays in IBD diagnosis may be related to focusing on comorbid or inaccurate diagnoses.\n\nIBD and ongoing inflammation can lead to impairment of growth and pubertal development in children. Impaired linear growth may be the only presenting symptom of IBD in pediatric patients. Growth impairment is multifactorial in nature, representing the summation of nutritional deficiencies, altered eating habits, inflammatory cytokines, and corticosteroid use.", "There is no relevant information in the given portion of the document for the treatment of a patient with severe ulcerative colitis who has lost response to vedolizumab.", "Relevant text:\n- \"Appropriately risk-stratifying prognosis in patients recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strategies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to extensive and complicated.

In higher-risk patients, early control of inflammation with immune-modifying therapies is critical.\"\n- \"Although the former refers to the burden of inflammation at any given point in time, the latter takes into account the disease phenotype and course, and is helpful in determining prognosis and predicting complications.\"\n- \"Numerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis is tied to adverse outcomes in both CD and UC. In CD, being diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associated with an increased risk of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, including higher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence, and disease recurrence. In UC, younger age at diagnosis is linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colorectal cancer.\"\n- \"There are significant differences in IBD phenotype and outcomes based on race and ethnicity, likely due to a multitude of factors, both social and biologic.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be used to optimize both thiopurines and biologics. TDM for biologics may offer a cost benefit compared to empirical adjustments of therapy. If target drug concentrations are not achieved, escalation of dose, shortening of interval, and/or adding an immunomodulator may be recommended, with subsequent reassessment of drug concentration until targets are reached.

The subanalyses re- ported a trend toward more safety, less use of concomitant steroids and a slightly better endoscopic response (particularly in patients with higher endoscopic scores at baseline) in the ustekinumab group.\"\n\nThese texts provide information on the comparative efficacy of vedolizumab and adalimumab in ulcerative colitis, as well as the efficacy of ustekinumab compared to adalimumab in Crohn's disease. However, there is no specific information on the use of biological drugs in patients who have lost response to vedolizumab.", "In CD, a meta-analysis of 9 randomized trials with mixed \ufb01rst-line and second line indications con\ufb01rmed the superiority of in\ufb02iximab alone for induction (OR 2.8) or in combination with azathioprine for maintenance of remission (OR 3.0) (Hazlewood et al., 2015). A recent pooled analysis of 4 clinical trial programs (EXTEND, UNITY, VERSIFY, CPT-13 BIO-SIMILAR) was presented at ECCO congress 2022 and con\ufb01rmed that in\ufb02iximab achieved a higher proportion of 1-year endoscopic healing compared to adalimumab, ustekinumab and vedolizumab in CD patients, but not in bio-na\u00efve patients (Narula et al., 2022).\n\nAs second line therapy, it is also important to consider that the ef\ufb01cacy of vedolizumab will be in\ufb02uenced by previous anti-TNF exposure, a numerical difference was seen in the response to therapy in UC (Feagan et al., 2017) and CD patients (Sands et al., 2017). An impact which was clearly signi\ufb01cant at week 6 after induction (Sands et al., 2014).\n\nIn the most recent publication from the American Gastroenterology Association: \u201cTechnical Review, the Medical Management of Moderate to Severe Luminal and Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease\u201d, the conclusion was that in biologic-na\u00efve patients with moderate to severely active CD, in\ufb02iximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab are the most effective compared to vedolizumab and certolizumab pegol. In\ufb02iximab was considered the strongest for induction. However, in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to in\ufb02iximab), the bene\ufb01t of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain.", "The text relevant to the treatment of a patient with severe ulcerative colitis who has lost response to vedolizumab is as follows:\n\n\"In current clinical practice we are confronted with numerous options of treatment sequencing. Personalizing IBD treatment depends on previous drug exposure IBD (1st, 2nd, 3rd line of treatment), prior treatment response, comorbidities, safety profile, patient preferences and patient risk for future IBD complications (disease severity). For example, primary non-response to an anti-TNF was found to be a predictor for diminished treatment efficacy with an anti-integrin biologic (Singh et al., 2018c). First and second-line agent treatment sequences and treatment response have been presented in the previous chapter. However, data are even scarcer concerning the third line of treatment after two anti-TNFs exposure. A retrospective small series of 67 patients with Crohn's disease treated with 3rd line anti-TNF agent (Allez et al., 2010) reported a lower response rate and the lack of late responders at 6 months. A recent multicenter retrospective study reported the outcome of patients with late CD who had failed treatment with one anti-TNF agent and either vedolizumab or ustekinumab. After 48 weeks on a third line of biologic therapy, the remission rate was 30.7% whereas the surgery rate was 23.5% (Kassouri et al., 2020).\"\n\nThis text discusses the options for treatment sequencing and the potential efficacy of different biologic agents in patients who have failed previous treatments, including anti-TNF agents and vedolizumab. It suggests that a third-line biologic therapy, such as ustekinumab, may be considered for patients who have lost response to vedolizumab.", "In older IBD patients, a protective effect against the development of severe adverse events have been demonstrated in UC when administering vedolizumab compared to anti-TNF agents. Earlier publications also suggested a very good safety of anti-TNF agents in older populations. At this stage, we can thus consider all biological agents, when indicated, as safe in all populations.\n\nIn some large clinical trials, initiation of biologic therapy at a younger age was associated with better response, for example infliximab in both CD and UC patients. However, other studies did not find such an association as well as no differences in response according to gender. Although much fewer studies are available, remission rates observed with vedolizumab in elderly and pediatric population appear to match those reported in the general adult population. The same observations were also made for ustekinumab.\n\nThere is little data on the impact of BMI on the response to vedolizumab or ustekinumab in IBD, but response to the second was lower in a study of obese patients with psoriasis.\n\nIt is important to consider the patient's age, response to previous biologic therapy, and BMI when determining the appropriate biological treatment for severe ulcerative colitis.", "Only limited data are available regarding ustekinumab in early CD. In a retrospective pediatric cohort, treated with ustekinumab, the rate of remission was 61.1% in patients despite prior anti-TNF failure, suggesting a high potential with this agent in early disease (Kim et al., 2021).", "Vedolizumab may not represent the most appropriate biologic in presence of articular manifestations of IBD. Indeed, by virtue of its binding to \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, this antibody may not impede the entry of proinflammatory cells in joints. In fact, it may even contribute to higher influx of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who observed de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated IBD patients (Diaz et al., 2020). An increased incidence of extraintestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also been observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims database (Dubinsky et al., 2018). However, by improving disease activity these drugs could still have an indirect impact on associated EIM, mostly peripheral arthritis, as suggested by the recent EMOTIVE retrospective analysis (Kopylov et al., 2021). Ustekinumab, however, has also limited role in this indication, as this drug is also indicated in rheumatoid arthritis (Kerschbaumer et al., 2020).", "The relevant text for the treatment of a patient with severe ulcerative colitis who has lost response to vedolizumab is as follows:\n\n\"Optimizing biologic therapy in IBD: how essential is therapeutic drug monitoring?\" - This article discusses the importance of therapeutic drug monitoring in achieving high trough levels of biologic drugs to achieve the therapeutic goal of fistula closure.\n\n\"Comorbidity, not patient age, is associated with impaired safety outcomes in vedolizumab- and ustekinumab-treated patients with inflammatory bowel disease\" - This study examines the safety outcomes of vedolizumab treatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting that comorbidity may be a factor in impaired safety outcomes.\n\nTherefore, for a patient with severe ulcerative colitis who has lost response to vedolizumab, it may be important to consider therapeutic drug monitoring and evaluate for comorbidities that may impact the safety outcomes of biologic treatment.", "Bonovas, S., Lytras, T., Nikolopoulos, G., Peyrin-Biroulet, L., Danese, S., 2018.

These biologics include infliximab (INF), adalimumab (ADA), golimumab (GOL), vedolizumab (VED), and ustekinumab (UST). However, treatment limitations for moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and parenteral administration.\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs (SMDs) for the treatment of UC.

Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) such as infliximab (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) are the mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe UC. These biologics have been shown to be superior to other therapies in managing moderate UC. It is important to note that biosimilars of IFX are available as less expensive alternatives. \n\nHowever, it is crucial to consider the patient's history of lymphoma and the potential risk of serious adverse events and infections associated with biologic therapy. Ustekinumab (UST) may be a consideration for risk-averse patients, as it has been associated with a lower risk of serious adverse events and infections. UST and vedolizumab (VDZ) are also effective first-line options with good safety profiles for moderate UC, especially when limited to the colon and without high-risk features. \n\nIt is important to monitor patients closely and reassess symptoms, as well as monitor fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. If patients have mild disease activity, an 8-week course of budesonide can be tried, and patients can be monitored off therapy after stopping steroids. Immunomodulators (IMMs) may be considered in nonresponsive moderate disease, but long-term safety concerns limit their use. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the positioning of biologics in UC treatment is based on indirect data, such as network meta-analyses and real-world retrospective studies. Ongoing head-to-head trials will provide further clarification on the positioning of biologics in UC management.", "Combination therapy of a biologic with IMM, best-studied with TNFi, is an important consideration in severe disease, especially penetrating or perianal disease. It is associated with improved outcomes, a decrease in loss of TNFi response, and fewer long-term complications. The mechanism of action may be due to decrease in immunogenicity and impact on drug level. Similar effects have not been seen with adding IMM to UST of VDZ therapy, possibly due to a lower role of immunogenicity in drug metabolism. For patients with perianal CD, a multidisciplinary approach with early referral to a colorectal surgeon is key to improved outcomes.", "In patients with severe UC requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for induction and maintenance of remission, with or without IMM.

However, available data from RCTs of small molecule drugs show that they induce similar rates of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement to biologics. Moreover, safety concerns have arisen surrounding the use of tofacitinib, especially regarding the potential risk of venous thromboembolism and herpes zoster infection. One meta-analysis found an increased risk of herpes zoster infection with the use of JAK inhibitors in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. This adverse event could be easily prevented by appropriate vaccination. The same meta-analysis did not find an increased risk of venous thromboembolism with the use of JAK inhibitors, although, until further evidence becomes available, caution is advised when considering JAK inhibitors as treatment options, especially in patients with known risk factors for thrombosis. Selective JAK-1 inhibitors, such as upadacitinib and filgotinib, were developed to improve the risk\u2013benefit profile of this therapeutic class. However, in our study, upadacitinib was ranked highest for all adverse events and filgotinib was ranked third highest among active interventions (ie, not including placebo) for serious adverse events, opposing this notion.

The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These new agents have now proved their efficacy not only against placebo but also in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in specific indications (Sands et al., 2019, 2021; Irving et al., 2021).
