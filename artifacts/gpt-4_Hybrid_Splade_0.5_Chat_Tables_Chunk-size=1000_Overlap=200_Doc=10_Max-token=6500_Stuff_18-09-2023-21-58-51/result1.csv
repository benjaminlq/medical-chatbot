Extraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and
represent an important cause of morbidity and disability (Vavricka et al.,
2011; Juillerat et al., 2020). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect
30% of patients. They include non-inﬂammatory joint pain as well as
inﬂammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as
spondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, inﬂiximab and later
the other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD
patient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials
in both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established efﬁcacies in most
rheumatological indications (Herfarth et al., 2002; Generini et al., 2004;

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient has moderate ulcerative colitis and has been previously treated with infliximab but is not responding well as his condition is worsening. 

Given this information, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient would be Ustekinumab and Tofacitinib. These drugs are ranked highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists like infliximab.

Here are the pros and cons of these two drugs:

1. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is ranked highest for inducing remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists. It also has a lower risk of infections compared to other drugs.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Ustekinumab is that it may not be as effective in patients who have had prior exposure to other biologic therapies.

2. Tofacitinib:
   - Advantages: Tofacitinib is also ranked highly for inducing remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists. 
   - Disadvantages: Tofacitinib may have a higher risk of infections compared to other drugs. It also may not be as effective in patients who have had prior exposure to other biologic therapies.

DISCUSSION 
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of 
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has 
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical 
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all 
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these 
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. 
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were 
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of 
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC

Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We 
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative 
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the

inferior, but cheaper, drug should be used to treat moderate to severe UC is not the subject of 
the current study. The results of this network meta-analysis could, however, be used to 
inform a cost-effectiveness analysis to help guide future treatment selection.

moderate to severe UC, and all drugs, other than adalimumab 80/40mg, were superior to 
placebo in terms of endoscopic improvement. Among biological therapies, infliximab ranked 
highest for all endpoints in all patients, and in patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs, with 
ustekinumab ranked highest for all endpoints in patients exposed to anti-TNF-α therapy. In","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.

and severity. Although the former refers to the burden of
inﬂammation at any given point in time, the latter takes into
account the disease phenotype and course, and is helpful in

(little to no symptoms and low inﬂammatory markers) may
actually have high severity (due to disease history or
behavior) increasing the risk for disease progression, and
should be managed more proactively and aggressively. We
will review predictors of IBD severity and activity.

are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title:

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

text: (prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs."

Our study has several limitations besides the usual 
limitations of network meta-analyses. First, data from 
some clinical trials with newer small molecule drugs were 
extracted from conference abstracts, and the full data could 
not be completely analysed. Notably, we could only analyse 
outcomes for the overall population as the main analysis, 
and not according to previous exposure to biologics. We 
did do an exploratory analysis according to previous

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Discussion 
We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs 
of biologics and small molecule drugs (approved or in a 
late stage of development) for induction and maintenance 
treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative 
colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics, 
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than 
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and 
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study 
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of 
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and 
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other 
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab 
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety, 
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in 
terms of adverse events and serious adverse events, as 
previously 
observed","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Fifth, we analysed steroid-free remission—a more robust 
and 
clinically 
meaningful 
outcome 
than 
clinical 
remission—in maintenance trials only, as corticosteroid 
tapering was not allowed in induction trials. In addition, 
not all clinical trials reported on steroid-free remission, 
particularly the older trials. Finally, some preliminary 
reports, such as the trial of maintenance with subcutaneous 
vedolizumab, did not report relevant data for endoscopic 
improvement. 
As with any indirect comparison, the results presented 
in this study should be interpreted with caution but could 
help clinicians to navigate the current scenario in which 
the number of therapeutic options for moderate-to-
severe ulcerative colitis is steadily increasing. These 
findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating, 
until direct comparisons by means of head-to-head trials 
become available to fully elucidate the positioning of","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

effect likely is real and not confounded by treatment
refractoriness.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Vedolizumab. 

Infliximab is often favored as a first-line agent for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. Additionally, it is also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which the patient also has.

Vedolizumab is another first-line agent for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets inflammation in the gut, potentially leading to fewer systemic side effects.

Here are the pros and cons of each:

Infliximab:
- Advantages: Effective in inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis, can also be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, has a long track record and is generally well-tolerated.
- Disadvantages: Risk of developing anti-drug antibodies which can decrease its effectiveness, potential for systemic side effects as it is not gut-selective, risk of serious infections and potential increased risk of certain cancers.

Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: Effective in inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis, gut-selective which may lead to fewer systemic side effects.
- Disadvantages: May not be as effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, slower onset of action compared to other biologics, risk of serious infections.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

The therapeutic armamentarium for moderate-to-severe 
ulcerative colitis has expanded considerably in recent years. 
Drug development has shifted over the last decade to small 
molecule drugs in an effort to overcome the intrinsic limitations 
of treatment with biologics. In this context of ever-expanding 
treatment options, frequent updates of indirect comparisons

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,"

ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

ABSTRACT 
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to 
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning 
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.  
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged 
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and 
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as 
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked 
according to their P-score. 
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical 
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Our study has several limitations besides the usual 
limitations of network meta-analyses. First, data from 
some clinical trials with newer small molecule drugs were 
extracted from conference abstracts, and the full data could 
not be completely analysed. Notably, we could only analyse 
outcomes for the overall population as the main analysis, 
and not according to previous exposure to biologics. We 
did do an exploratory analysis according to previous 
biologic exposure, but data for upadacitinib could not be 
included. Second, no phase 3 RCTs with etrasimod or

Human: question","Based on the given patient profile, the patient has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and has lost response to tofacitinib. Considering the patient's age and prior response to tofacitinib, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Infliximab and Ustekinumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a preferred first-line agent for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It has a strong effect size for inducing clinical remission.
   - Disadvantages: As with any medication, there is a risk of side effects, including serious infections. Some patients may also develop anti-drug antibodies to Infliximab, reducing its effectiveness over time.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been found to be efficacious in patients who fail infliximab. It also has a superior safety profile, which may be attractive for patients concerned about side effects.
   - Disadvantages: The overall event rate for important safety outcomes is low, but as with any medication, there is a risk of side effects.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be made in consultation with the patient, taking into account the patient's preferences, the balance of risk-benefit profile, and the costs/resources available.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel"

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab (VDZ) and Ustekinumab (UST). 

1. Vedolizumab (VDZ)
   - Advantages: VDZ has been shown to be superior in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC. It has a good safety profile and is generally well-tolerated.
   - Disadvantages: VDZ is administered via intravenous infusion, which may not align with the patient's preference for an oral formulation. It may also not be feasible due to payer preference.

2. Ustekinumab (UST)
   - Advantages: UST is an effective option for moderate UC with a good safety profile. It may be a better first-choice option than TNFi due to its safety profile.
   - Disadvantages: Similar to VDZ, UST is also administered via intravenous infusion, which may not be preferred by the patient. It may also not be feasible due to payer preference.

Please note that the final decision should be made after a thorough discussion with the patient, considering her preferences, the severity of her condition, and other factors such as cost and availability of the drugs.

Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only

rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

field were contacted for any unpublished data.
We included phase 3 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria: 
(1) studies including adult (≥18 years) patients with 
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (defined as a Mayo 
Score of 6–12, with an endoscopic sub-score of 2–3) who 
were either biologic-naive or had previously been exposed 
to at least one biologic; (2) studies either evaluating the 
following biologics and small molecule drugs in their 
approved dose regimens, infliximab (intravenous or 
subcutaneous), adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab 
(intravenous or sub cutaneous), ustekinumab (intravenous 
or subcutaneous), tofacitinib, or ozanimod, or studies
