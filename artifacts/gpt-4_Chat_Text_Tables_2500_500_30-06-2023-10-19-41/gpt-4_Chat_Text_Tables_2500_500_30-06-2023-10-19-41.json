A useful adjunct\nto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool\nmarker of in\ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC \ufffd 40 mg/\ng carried a \ufffd1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index \ufffd8 and/\nor FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to\n100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional\nimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.\nWe refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn\u2019s and\nColitis\nOrganization,\nand\nBritish\nSociety\nof\nGastro-\nenterology.37\u201340\nRisk Strati\ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately\nrisk-stratifying\nprognosis\nin\npatients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection\nof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-\ngies.

However, treatment limitations for \nmoderately to severely active UC remain, including primary \nnonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and \nparenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, \nthere has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs \n(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-\nnogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the \nJanus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which \ntofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are \ncurrently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-\nverely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-\ntolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally \nadministered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their \nJAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and \nUPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 \nover JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-\nerentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-\ntional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs \nof JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-\ntively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), \nis also approved for use in UC.10\nWith this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid \ntoward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of \ndevelopment for moderately to severely active UC. Most \nrecently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and \npublished a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist \nnetwork meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely \nUC.

Biologics with other targets were later approved \nfor the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, \nnamely vedolizumab and, more recently, usteki numab. \nHowever, \ntreatment \nwith \nbiologics \nhas \nseveral \nlimit ations, including limited efficacy, primary non-\nresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity,"}, {"title": "First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis", "filename": "PIIS1542356520300446.pdf", "page": 5, "text": "41 years (interquartile range, 40\u201342 y), and 60%\n(interquartile range, 56%\u201363%) were men.
