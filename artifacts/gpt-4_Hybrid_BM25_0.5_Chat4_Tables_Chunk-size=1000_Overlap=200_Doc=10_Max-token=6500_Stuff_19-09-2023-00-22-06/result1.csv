Extraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and
represent an important cause of morbidity and disability (Vavricka et al.,
2011; Juillerat et al., 2020). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect
30% of patients. They include non-inﬂammatory joint pain as well as
inﬂammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as
spondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, inﬂiximab and later
the other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD
patient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials
in both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established efﬁcacies in most
rheumatological indications (Herfarth et al., 2002; Generini et al., 2004;

Vedolizumab may not represent the most appropriate biologic in
presence of articular manifestations of IBD. Indeed, by virtue of its
binding to α4β7 integrin, this antibody may not impede the entry of
proinﬂammatory cells in joints. In fact, it may even contribute to higher
inﬂux of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who
observed de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated
IBD patients (Diaz et al., 2020). An increased incidence of extra-
intestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also
been observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims
database (Dubinsky et al., 2018). However, by improving disease activity
these drugs could still have an indirect impact on associated EIM, mostly
peripheral arthritis, as suggested by the recent EMOTIVE retrospective

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title:

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with 
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults 
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. 
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those 
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], 
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by 
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] 
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for 
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary 
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and 
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, 
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs 
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient has moderate ulcerative colitis and has been previously treated with infliximab but is not responding well as evidenced by worsening colitis on endoscopy. Therefore, the patient falls under the category of those with prior exposure to TNF antagonists. 

Given this, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient would be:

1. Ustekinumab
2. Tofacitinib

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

Ustekinumab:
- Advantages: Ustekinumab has been ranked highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement. It also has a lower risk of infections compared to other drugs.
- Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of ustekinumab is that it may not be as effective as other drugs in patients who are biologic-naive. 

Tofacitinib:
- Advantages: Tofacitinib is also ranked highly in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement. It can be administered orally and on a daily basis, which may be more convenient for some patients.
- Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of tofacitinib is that it may have a higher risk of infections compared to other drugs.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and preferences, and in consultation with their healthcare provider.

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title:

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety 
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary 
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across 
advanced therapies.

In the last 10 years small molecules, which can be administered orally and on a daily 
basis, have also been evaluated in moderate to severe UC. These include janus kinase 
inhibitors, such as tofacitinib,[20] and the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, 
ozanimod.[21] The comparative efficacy and safety of all these drugs has been assessed in 
prior network meta-analyses.[22, 23] These demonstrated that infliximab was ranked highest 
overall for efficacy, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with 
previous anti-TNF-α exposure. However, this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already 
several newer drugs that have shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not 
considered in these network meta-analyses.[24-26] We have therefore performed an updated

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Adalimumab. 

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets inflammation in the gut, reducing systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. It is also less likely to cause serious infections compared to other biologics.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to show effects compared to other biologics. It is administered via intravenous infusion, which may not be convenient for all patients. There is also a risk of infusion-related reactions.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe UC. It is administered via subcutaneous injection, which can be done at home.
   - Disadvantages: Adalimumab can increase the risk of serious infections and may not be suitable for patients with a history of recurrent infections. It can also cause allergic reactions and other side effects like headache, rash, and nausea.

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with 
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults 
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. 
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those 
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], 
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by 
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] 
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for 
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary 
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and 
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, 
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs 
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

likely to present with strictures (P < .001) and require

diagnostic delay has been associated with complications
such as strictures and internal ﬁstulae.25 In a study, of adult

1. Ustekinumab (UST)
   - Advantages: UST is an anti-interleukin-12/23 antibody that has shown efficacy in treating both UC and psoriasis, which is an extraintestinal manifestation present in this patient. It can be a good choice for patients with both conditions.
   - Disadvantages: As with any medication, there can be side effects. These can include respiratory infections, fatigue, headache, and injection site reactions. There is also a risk of serious infections, malignancies, and hypersensitivity reactions.

higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults 
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. 
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those 
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], 
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by 
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] 
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for 
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary 
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and 
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, 
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs 
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

In the last 10 years small molecules, which can be administered orally and on a daily 
basis, have also been evaluated in moderate to severe UC. These include janus kinase 
inhibitors, such as tofacitinib,[20] and the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, 
ozanimod.[21] The comparative efficacy and safety of all these drugs has been assessed in 
prior network meta-analyses.[22, 23] These demonstrated that infliximab was ranked highest 
overall for efficacy, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with 
previous anti-TNF-α exposure. However, this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already 
several newer drugs that have shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not 
considered in these network meta-analyses.[24-26] We have therefore performed an updated

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Adalimumab. Both drugs are anti-TNF agents, which are effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a potent anti-inflammatory drug that can induce and maintain remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also effective in treating ankylosing spondylitis. Infliximab has a rapid onset of action and can lead to symptom relief within a few weeks.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered via intravenous infusion, which can be inconvenient for some patients. It can also cause side effects such as infections, allergic reactions, and liver damage. There is also a risk of developing antibodies against infliximab, which can reduce its effectiveness.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is also effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is administered via subcutaneous injection, which can be done at home, providing convenience for the patient.
   - Disadvantages: Adalimumab may take longer to work compared to infliximab. It can also cause side effects such as infections, allergic reactions, and liver damage. Similar to infliximab, there is a risk of developing antibodies against adalimumab, which can reduce its effectiveness.

It's important to note that the choice between these two drugs should be individualized based on the patient's preferences, lifestyle, and overall health status. The patient should also be closely monitored for any side effects during the treatment.",,,,,,,"title:

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults 
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. 
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those 
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], 
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by 
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] 
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for 
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary 
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and 
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, 
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs 
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also a good option for patients who have a history of malignancy like this patient as it has a lower risk of reactivating latent malignancies compared to other biologics.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to work compared to other biologics. It also requires intravenous administration which can be inconvenient for some patients. 

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is a biologic that targets interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, key cytokines involved in inflammatory and immune responses. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also a good option for patients with a history of malignancy as it has a lower risk of reactivating latent malignancies.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab requires an initial intravenous infusion followed by subcutaneous injections, which can be inconvenient for some patients. It may also be less effective in patients who have previously failed anti-TNF therapy.

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus 
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials. 
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC 
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with 
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.  
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We 
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative 
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the 
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

becomes available, caution is advised when considering 
JAK inhibitors as treatment options, especially in patients 
with known risk factors for thrombosis. Selective JAK-1 
inhibitors, such as upadacitinib and filgotinib, were 
developed to improve the risk–benefit profile of this 
therapeutic class.44 However, in our study, upadacitinib 
was ranked highest for all adverse events and filgotinib 
was ranked third highest among active interventions (ie, 
not including placebo) for serious adverse events, 
opposing this notion.
Representing a surprising finding of this study, 
ozanimod ranked highest for the occurrence of serious 
adverse events. Ozanimod is a selective sphingosine 
1-phosphate modulator approved for the treatment of 
multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis in the USA. Another 
meta-analysis showed that sphingosine 1-phosphate

Given this, two potential biological drugs that could be considered are:

1. Adalimumab
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is a TNF inhibitor that can help control symptoms and achieve remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can be administered at home and does not require intravenous infusion.
   - Disadvantages: Adalimumab may increase the risk of serious infections and malignancies. Given the patient's history of malignant melanoma, this risk should be carefully considered. Regular monitoring for skin cancer is recommended.

2. Vedolizumab
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets inflammation in the gut, potentially causing fewer systemic side effects. It may be a suitable option for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate TNF inhibitors.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab requires intravenous infusion, which can be less convenient than self-administered injections. The risk of infection is also a concern, although it may be lower than with TNF inhibitors.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, including disease severity, comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal preferences.

• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor

CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of 
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and 
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other 
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab 
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety, 
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in

DISCUSSION 
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of 
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has 
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical 
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all 
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these 
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. 
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were 
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of 
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

ABSTRACT 
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to 
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning 
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.  
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged 
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and 
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as 
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked 
according to their P-score. 
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical 
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,"

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Adalimumab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can be administered as an intravenous infusion every 8 weeks after the initial loading doses, which may be more convenient for some patients.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Vedolizumab is that it requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient for some patients. Additionally, it may take several weeks to months to see the full effect of the drug.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can be self-administered as a subcutaneous injection, which may be more convenient for patients who prefer to avoid hospital visits.
   - Disadvantages: Some patients may experience injection site reactions. Additionally, as with all immunosuppressants, there is a risk of serious infections and potential for increased risk of malignancies.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and preferences, and in consultation with their healthcare provider.",,,,,,,"title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be:

1. Infliximab
2. Upadacitinib

Infliximab:
- Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also ranked highest in biologic-naïve patients for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement.
- Disadvantages: Infliximab has potential side effects including risk of serious infections, lymphoma, and other malignancies. It also has the potential for primary non-response or secondary loss of response.

Upadacitinib:
- Advantages: Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis based on ITT analyses, with similar safety across advanced therapies. It may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic response over 1 year.
- Disadvantages: The safety profile of upadacitinib is still being evaluated, and it may have potential side effects including serious infections, malignancies, and thrombosis. It also requires regular monitoring for changes in blood counts, liver enzymes, and cholesterol levels.

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, she is a patient under maintenance who is not responding to azathioprine therapy. Considering her age and the severity of her ulcerative colitis, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also beneficial for patients who have not responded to conventional therapy.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious infections and allergic reactions. It may also increase the risk of certain types of cancer.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and spares the rest of the body from immunosuppression. This can result in fewer side effects compared to other treatments.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to work compared to other treatments. It can also cause side effects such as headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever.

It's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and preferences. The patient should also be closely monitored for any side effects during the treatment.",,,,,,,"title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs for her severe ulcerative colitis and rare fistulating disease would be Infliximab and Adalimumab. 

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a potent anti-TNF agent that has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also particularly effective in treating fistulating diseases, which the patient has.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects, including infections (such as tuberculosis), heart failure, and potentially fatal lymphomas and other cancers. It can also cause infusion reactions, which can be severe.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is another anti-TNF agent that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered via subcutaneous injection, which some patients may find more convenient than the intravenous infusion required for infliximab.
   - Disadvantages: Like infliximab, adalimumab can cause serious side effects, including infections, heart failure, and potentially fatal lymphomas and other cancers. It can also cause injection site reactions.

  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets inflammation in the gut, reducing systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to show effects compared to other biologics. It also requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient for some patients. There is also a risk of infusion-related reactions.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can be administered subcutaneously after the initial intravenous dose, which can be more convenient for the patient.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may increase the risk of infections. It may also not be as effective in patients who have previously failed anti-TNF therapy.

It's important to note that the patient's age and history of prostate cancer should be taken into consideration when choosing a treatment. Both Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab have been associated with a slight increase in the risk of infections, which could potentially be more serious in older patients or those with a history of cancer.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title:

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety 
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary 
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across 
advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel"

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

of infections (SUCRA, 0.81), followed by ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.63) in maintenance trials.
CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision making with greater conﬁdence.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

There is no information provided about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis.

Given the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been found to be highly effective in inducing remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is particularly beneficial for patients who have not been previously exposed to TNF antagonists.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects including infections, infusion reactions, and potential for developing antibodies against the drug which can decrease its effectiveness.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to work compared to other biologics. It also carries the risk of common side effects such as headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized 
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs 
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title:

ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis
