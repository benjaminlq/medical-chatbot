As per the given context, the advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.

Tofacitinib: Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe UC. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. The advantages of Tofacitinib are that it is an oral medication, which is convenient for patients, and it has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. The disadvantages of Tofacitinib are that it can cause serious infections, malignancies, and thrombosis.\n\n2.

It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. The advantages of Vedolizumab are that it is a targeted therapy that does not affect the entire immune system, and it has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC.
