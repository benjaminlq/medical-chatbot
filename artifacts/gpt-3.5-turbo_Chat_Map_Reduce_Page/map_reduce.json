Complications associated with ongoing inflammation in UC include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and colorectal cancer. Other complications include anemia, nutritional deficiencies, loss of bone density, and progressive loss of quality of life. \n\nEarly management of UC can alter the disease course and prevent complications. Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term UC complications are mitigated by early treatment and remission. It is important to achieve deep remission in order to lower the risk of hospitalization, surgery, and other complications associated with UC. \n\nIn the case of extraintestinal manifestations, such as articular involvement, early and aggressive treatment is recommended to control inflammation and prevent further complications.

Certain baseline clinical features are associated with a more aggressive disease course with higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk patients, early control of inflammation with immune-modifying therapies is critical.\n- There are significant differences in IBD phenotype and outcomes based on race and ethnicity, likely due to a multitude of factors, both social and biologic. Emergency department use, hospitalization, complicated disease course, and IBD-related disability are more common in minority and lower socioeconomic status groups.\n- There are increasing data on sex-based differences in IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be more common in female patients.", "In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease advised by the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers and prior use of biologics. Extensive colitis, deep ulcers, need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difficile, and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colectomy risk. Of note, disease extension from limited disease to extensive or pancolitis is associated with worse prognosis.

Additionally, commercially available IBD serologic markers can help with prognostication. These include perinuclear antineutrophil antibody and several antimicrobial antibodies, notably anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody, antibody to Escherichia coli outer-membrane porin C, and antibody to flagellin (CBir1). In the Pediatric RISK Stratification study, a large prospective study of CD, patients positive for 2 or more serologic markers (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody, outer-membrane porin C, and/or CBir1) progressed to a penetrating or stricturing complication more quickly than those with only 1 serologic marker, and those receiving anti-TNF in this cohort had a reduced likelihood of progression to penetrating complications, indicating a window to change disease complication.", "There is no relevant text in this portion of the document for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs.", "In the management of early moderate to severe UC, biological drugs may be considered. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) such as infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) have been shown to be superior to other therapies for moderate UC. Biosimilars of IFX are also approved as less expensive alternatives. Ustekinumab (UST) may be a consideration for risk-averse patients, as it has been associated with a lower risk of serious adverse events and infections. Vedolizumab (VDZ) and UST are effective first-line options with good safety profiles, especially for moderate UC limited to the colon and without high-risk features. It is important to note that response to VDZ may be lower among patients who have been exposed to TNFis, while biologic-na\u00efve patients tend to have higher response rates. Ongoing head-to-head trials will provide further clarification on the positioning of biologics in UC treatment.", "Combination therapy of a biologic with IMM, best-studied with TNFi, is an important consideration in severe disease, especially penetrating or perianal disease. It is associated with improved outcomes, a decrease in loss of TNFi response, and fewer long-term complications. \n\nFor patients with perianal CD, a multidisciplinary approach with early referral to a colorectal surgeon is key to improved outcomes.\n\nDietary therapy. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the use of polymeric or elemental formula typically for 8\u201312 weeks to induce remission in CD.

For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effective options, and may be better first-choice options than TNFi, given safety profile. In the VARSITY trial, VDZ was superior to ADA in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC. In case VDZ or UST may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, particularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety profile. Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after weighing risks against benefits. In patients with severe UC requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for induction and maintenance of remission, with or without IMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was associated with improved clinical outcomes compared to IFX monotherapy. When using IFX as a monotherapy in moderate to severe UC, it is recommended to check early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing and detecting immunogenicity early. There is no clear benefit of concomitant mesalamine with biologic therapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to biologics.", "We recommend identifying an appropriate target for treatment, depending on disease characteristics, availability of resources, and patient preference, and treating to achieve normalization of the target, followed by periodic reassessment. The primary therapeutic goal should be clinical and endoscopic remission. Treatment should be optimized to achieve maximal benefit to the patient, and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may be used to adjust the dose and interval of medication or add a medication to use in combination. TDM is typically used to optimize both thiopurines and biologics. Monitoring inflammatory markers such as fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) can help maintain the target and predict relapse before clinical symptoms occur.

A recent pooled analysis of 4 clinical trial programs (EXTEND, UNITY, VERSIFY, CPT-13 BIO-SIMILAR) was presented at ECCO congress 2022 and con\ufb01rmed that in\ufb02iximab achieved a higher proportion of 1-year endoscopic healing compared to adalimumab, ustekinumab and vedolizumab in CD patients, but not in bio-na\u00efve patients (Narula et al., 2022).\n\nAs second line therapy, it is also important to consider that the ef\ufb01cacy of vedolizumab will be in\ufb02uenced by previous anti-TNF exposure, a numerical difference was seen in the response to therapy in UC (Feagan et al., 2017) and CD patients (Sands et al., 2017). An impact which was clearly signi\ufb01cant at week 6 after induction (Sands et al., 2014).\n\nIn summary, the most recent meta-analysis in CD which included ustekinumab concluded that in\ufb02iximab or adalimumab are the best \ufb01rst-line agents, and ustekinumab a preferred second-line agent in patients with prior anti-TNF alpha agents\u2019 exposure (Singh et al., 2018b).\n\nThere is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD patients. During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to responders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R, and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T cells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019) when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have occurred.", "There is no relevant information in the provided text regarding the treatment of moderate UC with biological drugs in a patient with articular extraintestinal manifestations.", "Relevant text:\n\"Since their approval in IBD, in\ufb02iximab and later the other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD patient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials in both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established ef\ufb01cacies in most rheumatological indications (Herfarth et al., 2002; Generini et al., 2004; Lofberg et al., 2012; Louis et al., 2018).\"\n\n\"Vedolizumab may not represent the most appropriate biologic in presence of articular manifestations of IBD. Indeed, by virtue of its binding to \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, this antibody may not impede the entry of proin\ufb02ammatory cells in joints. In fact, it may even contribute to higher in\ufb02ux of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who observed de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated IBD patients (Diaz et al., 2020). An increased incidence of extra-intestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also been observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims database (Dubinsky et al., 2018). However, by improving disease activity these drugs could still have an indirect impact on associated EIM, mostly peripheral arthritis, as suggested by the recent EMOTIVE retrospective analysis (Kopylov et al., 2021).\"\n\nTherefore, in the case of a patient with newly diagnosed moderate UC and articular extraintestinal manifestations, treatment with anti-TNF agents such as in\ufb02iximab would be the best choice.

For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during maintenance.", "The relevant text from the document is as follows:\n\n\"The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflammatory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs (SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immunogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are currently approved for use in adults with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally administered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their JAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and UPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 over JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA preferentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selectively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), is also approved for use in UC.10\"\n\nThis text provides information on the use of biologics and small molecule drugs (SMDs) for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC.

The risk of surgery for UC can be up to 15.6% 10 years after diagnosis. The symptoms associated with UC can lead to progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinal damage and risk of complications if not treated adequately. Complications associated with ongoing inflammation in UC include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and colorectal cancer. Other complications include anemia, nutritional deficiencies, loss of bone density, and progressive loss of quality of life. Delay in diagnosis can lead to adverse outcomes and complications such as strictures and internal fistulae. Early management can alter the disease course and prevent complications.", "Appropriately risk-stratifying prognosis in patients recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strategies. Certain baseline clinical features are associated with a more aggressive disease course with higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk patients, early control of inflammation with immune-modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppressive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the short- and long-term, and entail significant health care costs. Therefore, a consideration of risks, benefits, and alternatives is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the informed patient.\n\nThere are conflicting data on the disease course in the very-early-onset IBD population of patients diagnosed before age 6 years, with studies reporting both similar and worse outcomes in very-early-onset IBD compared to the general pediatric population. Similar to the youngest patients with IBD, elderly-onset IBD (diagnosed at 60\u201365 years of age) has conflicting evidence on prognosis, with 1 study reporting fewer hospitalizations and less frequent requirement of immunosuppression in patients diagnosed after age 60 years, and a meta-analysis suggested that, although elderly IBD presents less commonly with complications, there are similar or higher rates of surgery compared to a nonelderly population. It is being increasingly recognized that frailty, rather than chronologic age, may be the driver of adverse outcomes in this group.\n\nThere are significant differences in IBD phenotype and outcomes based on race and ethnicity, likely due to a multitude of factors, both social and biologic. Emergency department use, hospitalization, complicated disease course, and IBD-related disability are more common in minority and lower socioeconomic status groups. Genes implicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared with White patients with IBD. Being aware of the higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in these vulnerable groups should prompt careful monitoring to limit adverse outcomes.\n\nThere are increasing data on sex-based differences in IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences in pathogenic pathways and progression.

In older IBD patients, a protective effect against the development of severe adverse events have been demonstrated in UC when administering vedolizumab compared to anti-TNF agents. Earlier publications also suggested a very good safety of anti-TNF agents in older populations. At this stage, we can thus consider all biological agents, when indicated, as safe in all populations.\n\nAlthough much fewer studies are available, remission rates observed with vedolizumab in elderly population appear to match those reported in the general adult population. The same observations were also made for ustekinumab.\n\nIt is unclear whether obesity influences response to biological therapies in IBD patients.

In a retrospective pediatric cohort, treated with ustekinumab, the rate of remission was 61.1% in patients despite prior anti-TNF failure, suggesting a high potential with this agent in early disease (Kim et al., 2021).\n\nIn UC, only limited data are available to guide therapy of isolated proctitis with biological agents. In a national retrospective study in France, half of 104 patients with ulcerative proctitis achieved remission with various anti-TNF therapies and 60% achieved mucosal healing (Pineton de Chambrun et al., 2020). In a large retrospective single center cohort, clinical response to biological therapy (mostly infliximab) was obtained in 70% of 118 5-ASA refractory ulcerative proctitis patients, as compared to 11% with azathioprine (Dubois et al., 2020).\n\nRecent studies have linked the risk of antibody development against biologic therapies, in particular anti-TNF agents, to the HLA profile of patients (Sazonovs et al., 2020, 2021). The authors associated the carriage of the HLA-DQA1*05 allele, common to 40% of Europeans, with a higher rate of immunogenicity to infliximab and adalimumab.\n\nAlthough the serological biomarkers ASCA and pANCA have long been used to help classify indeterminate colitis, their value in guiding medical therapy is still limited. A recent study associated presence of ASCA with extensive and severe disease phenotype and the need for an early use of biologics for a better prognosis in a cohort of 273 CD pediatric patients (Chandrakumar et al., 2019), whereas a meta-analysis found that pANCA positive IBD patients had a lower response rate to infliximab therapy (Nguyen et al., 2015).\n\nExtraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and represent an important cause of morbidity and disability (Vavricka et al., 2011; Juillerat et al., 2020). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect 30% of patients.

Out of 366 patients who received induction with 5 mg/kg infliximab at Week 0, 2 and 6, 195 responders were randomized to maintenance therapy or placebo. At Week 54, 36% of infliximab treated patients had a complete absence of fistula against 19% in the placebo group (Sands et al., 2004).

For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during maintenance.\n\nUpadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety across advanced therapies.", "The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.

However, treatment limitations for moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and parenteral administration. To overcome these limitations, there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs (SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immunogenicity. Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are currently approved for use in adults with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.

Complications associated with ongoing inflammation in UC include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and colorectal cancer. Other complications include anemia, nutritional deficiencies, loss of bone density, and progressive loss of quality of life.\n\nThe concordance between intestinal inflammation and symptoms can be limited in UC. Therefore, the recommended treat-to-target approach aims to achieve endoscopic healing and control of inflammation and involves early, aggressive treatment in appropriate patients.\n\nDelay in diagnosis of UC can lead to adverse outcomes. Data has shown that delay in diagnosis is associated with higher risk of complications such as strictures and internal fistulae.

Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the use of polymeric or elemental formula typically for 8\u201312 weeks to induce remission in CD. European Pediatric Consensus guidelines recommend EEN as the first-line therapy to induce remission in pediatric patients with luminal CD. This is based on numerous randomized controlled trials demonstrating that EEN is as effective as corticosteroids. Relapse after this period of induction is common, typically leading to maintenance management with IMM or biologics. To increase adherence, a combination of partial enteral nutrition and the CD exclusion diet may be more tolerable and as effective in inducing remission in mild to moderate pediatric CD. Studies on EEN in adults are limited and have shown mixed results but warrant consideration in select cases.", "In moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effective options and may be better first-choice options than TNFi, given their safety profile. In the VARSITY trial, VDZ was superior to ADA in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC. If VDZ or UST are not feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, particularly IFX, is an effective option with a good safety profile. Thiopurines may also be considered in moderate UC after weighing the risks against the benefits. In patients with severe UC requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for induction and maintenance of remission. Combination therapy with IFX has been associated with improved clinical outcomes compared to monotherapy. When using IFX as a monotherapy in moderate to severe UC, it is recommended to check early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing and detect immunogenicity early. There is no clear benefit of concomitant mesalamine with biologic therapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to biologics.", "Given the patient's profile of moderate UC with worsening colitis on endoscopy despite prior exposure to infliximab, it is relevant to consider the use of biological drugs for treatment. The document mentions the use of a treat-to-target strategy with the primary therapeutic goal being clinical and endoscopic remission. The CALM trial, which studied patients with moderate to severe CD treated with TNFi early in their disease course, showed that a treat-to-target strategy of escalating TNFi and thiopurine therapy based on clinical symptoms and biomarker normalization resulted in more patients achieving mucosal healing at week 48 compared to using clinical symptoms alone. Additionally, the document mentions the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to optimize both thiopurines and biologics. TDM can help assess drug concentrations and the presence of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies, and can guide dose adjustments or the addition of medications to achieve target concentrations. It is also important to monitor patients regularly with clinical visits and noninvasive inflammatory markers such as fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to maintain target goals and detect relapse early.

The network meta-analysis showed that biological therapies, including infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, and golimumab, were significantly more effective than placebo or conventional therapy in achieving clinical remission. Small molecules, such as tofacitinib and ustekinumab, also showed efficacy in this patient population.\n\nConclusion: Biological therapies and small molecules are effective treatment options for moderate to severe UC. Clinicians should consider these agents in patients who have failed conventional therapy or have worsening disease despite compliance.\"\n\nBased on the relevant text, it is clear that biological therapies, including infliximab, are considered effective treatment options for moderate to severe UC.

The first is vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the homing receptor \u03b14\u03b27 integrin complex, blocking the interaction of the surface homing molecules of activated immune cells with the endothelium to reduce diapedesis. The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These new agents have now proved their efficacy not only against placebo but also in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in specific indications (Sands et al., 2019, 2021; Irving et al., 2021). Consequently, they possess a comfortable market position compared to the historical anti-TNF agents, when not surpassing them for certain targeted groups of patients. However, striking efficacy differences have not been shown to support their superiority and anti-TNF agents remain the most appropriate medications in presence of most concomitant extraintestinal manifestations or in fistulizing CD (Juillerat et al., 2020; Papamichael et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021).\"\n\nThis text mentions vedolizumab and ustekinumab as two additional biologicals that have shown efficacy in specific indications, including ulcerative colitis.

Interestingly, the rapidity of response was also similar between the two groups. The subanalyses re- ported a trend toward more safety, less use of concomitant steroids and a slightly better endoscopic response (particularly in patients with higher endoscopic scores at baseline) in the ustekinumab group.\"\n\nThis information suggests that ustekinumab may be a viable option for the treatment of moderate to severe UC in patients who have had prior exposure to infliximab. It shows similar efficacy to adalimumab and may have some advantages in terms of safety and endoscopic response.", "In CD, a meta-analysis of 9 randomized trials with mixed \ufb01rst-line and second line indications con\ufb01rmed the superiority of in\ufb02iximab alone for induction (OR 2.8) or in combination with azathioprine for maintenance of remission (OR 3.0) (Hazlewood et al., 2015). A recent pooled analysis of 4 clinical trial programs (EXTEND, UNITY, VERSIFY, CPT-13 BIO-SIMILAR) was presented at ECCO congress 2022 and con\ufb01rmed that in\ufb02iximab achieved a higher proportion of 1-year endoscopic healing compared to adalimumab, ustekinumab and vedolizumab in CD patients, but not in bio-na\u00efve patients (Narula et al., 2022).\n\nAs second line therapy, it is also important to consider that the ef\ufb01cacy of vedolizumab will be in\ufb02uenced by previous anti-TNF exposure, a numerical difference was seen in the response to therapy in UC (Feagan et al., 2017) and CD patients (Sands et al., 2017). An impact which was clearly signi\ufb01cant at week 6 after induction (Sands et al., 2014).\n\nIn summary, the most recent meta-analysis in CD which included ustekinumab concluded that in\ufb02iximab or adalimumab are the best \ufb01rst-line agents, and ustekinumab a preferred second-line agent in patients with prior anti-TNF alpha agents\u2019 exposure (Singh et al., 2018b).\n\nThere is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD patients. During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to responders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R, and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T cells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019) when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have occurred.", "In some large clinical trials, initiation of biologic therapy at a younger age was associated with better response, for example infliximab in both CD and UC patients (Vermeire et al., 2002; Billiet et al., 2015). However, other studies did not find such an association as well as no differences in response according to gender (Ferrante et al., 2008; Sprakes et al., 2012; Arias et al., 2015; Iborra et al., 2017). Although much fewer studies are available, remission rates observed with vedolizumab in elderly and pediatric population appear to match those reported in the general adult population (Asscher et al., 2020; Ibraheim et al., 2020). The same observations were also made for ustekinumab (Asscher et al., 2020; Conrad and Kelsen, 2020; Gisbert and Chaparro, 2020).", "Only limited data are available regarding ustekinumab in early CD. In a retrospective pediatric cohort, treated with ustekinumab, the rate of remission was 61.1% in patients despite prior anti-TNF failure, suggesting a high potential with this agent in early disease (Kim et al., 2021).\n\nIn UC, only limited data are available to guide therapy of isolated proctitis with biological agents. In a national retrospective study in France, half of 104 patients with ulcerative proctitis achieved remission with various anti-TNF therapies and 60% achieved mucosal healing (Pineton de Chambrun et al., 2020). In a large retrospective single center cohort, clinical response to biological therapy (mostly infliximab) was obtained in 70% of 118 5-ASA refractory ulcerative proctitis patients, as compared to 11% with azathioprine (Dubois et al., 2020).\n\nRegarding pouch patients, a recent large randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study presented at ECCO congress, the EARNEST trial, was the first significant benefits across multiple treatment outcomes in patients with chronic pouchitis after IPAA for UC (Travis et al., 2022). Till then our best options for pouchitis refractory to antibiotics were mostly anti-TNF agents but without very high level of evidence (Kayal and Dubinsky, 2022): only one randomized controlled trial with adalimumab (Kj\u00e6r et al., 2019).\n\nRecent studies have linked the risk of antibody development against biologic therapies, in particular anti-TNF agents, to the HLA profile of patients (Sazonovs et al., 2020, 2021). The authors associated the carriage of the HLA-DQA1*05 allele, common to 40% of Europeans, with a higher rate of immunogenicity to infliximab and adalimumab. Although details of the evidence has been discussed, the same association was found in the ABIRISK consortium in autoimmune diseases (Hassler et al., 2020). Whether information on HLA allele carriage can be used prospectively to identify patients at risk of developing antibodies for a specific prospective intervention remains to be seen.\n\nAlthough the serological biomarkers ASCA and pANCA have long been used to help classify indeterminate colitis, their value in guiding medical therapy is still limited. A recent study associated presence of ASCA with extensive and severe disease phenotype and the need for an early use of biologics for a better prognosis in a cohort of 273 CD pediatric patients (Chandrakumar et al., 2019), whereas a meta-analysis found that pANCA positive IBD patients had a lower response rate to infliximab therapy (Nguyen et al., 2015).", "The most appropriate drug should combine a rapid resolution of symptoms, good potential on pre-set targets, as well as an optimal long term safety pro\ufb01le. In this regard, perhaps the current available biological agents will be challenged by the development of the novel small molecules and a new generation of antibodies which are more focused on the key in\ufb02ammatory pathways and involved in the pathogenesis of IBD.", "Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included in the study investigating the comparative efficacy and safety of advanced therapies for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). The advanced therapies included infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and upadacitinib. \n\nThe study found that upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses. It had the highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance among bio-naive induction responders. \n\nFor safety, there were no significant differences in serious adverse events (AEs) or serious infections across all advanced therapies compared to placebo. However, golimumab had higher odds of all AEs compared to placebo during maintenance. On the other hand, upadacitinib had lower odds of discontinuation due to AEs compared to placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds of discontinuation due to AEs compared to placebo during maintenance.\n\nBased on this study, upadacitinib may be a suitable option for your patient with moderate UC and prior exposure to infliximab. It has shown high efficacy in induction and maintenance, and its safety profile is similar to other advanced therapies. However, it is important to consider individual patient factors and preferences when making treatment decisions.", "\"For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflammatory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and parenteral administration.\"\n\n\"Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are currently approved for use in adults with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.\"\n\n\"Despite these recent publications, there remain key gaps in our understanding of the comparative efficacy and safety of advanced therapies for moderately to severely active UC.

However, there were no trials of infliximab or golimumab as second-line agents, so their efficacy in this setting is unclear. It is important to note that vedolizumab was ranked safest, with the lowest rate of infections among active interventions. This information can inform clinical practice and guidelines directly and facilitate shared decision making for management of patients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis.", "We observed that both ustekinumab and tofacitinib were\nsignificantly more effective than vedolizumab and adalimumab for induction of remission. Findings from these indirect comparisons need to be interpreted with caution because these trials did not always mirror clinical practice. For example, current trials did not use therapeutic drug monitoring to understand the plausible mechanism of failure of initial biologic intervention. Given the potential differences in the efficacy of second-line interventions depending on the underlying reason for discontinuation of prior TNFa antagonists (primary nonresponse vs secondary loss of response vs intolerance), such information may be useful in making clinical treatment decisions in conjunction with findings from our analyses. In these analyses, data on how many prior TNFa antagonists to which a patient had been exposed was not reported consistently. It is conceivable that because TNFa antagonists were the first class of medications to be approved, patients treated with adalimumab or golimumab in clinical trials generally had exposure to only a single TNFa antagonist; in contrast, in subsequent trials of vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and ustekinumab, a significant proportion of patients may have been exposed to 2 or more biologic agents before clinical trial intervention, and inherently may be difficult to treat. However, trials of ustekinumab were conducted following approval of vedolizumab, and a subset of patients in these trials failed multiple TNFa antagonists and vedolizumab, conceivably making it a more refractory patient population. Despite this, we observed the superiority of ustekinumab over vedolizumab, suggesting the effect likely is real and not confounded by treatment refractoriness.", "Integrating \ufb01ndings from this meta-analysis and other studies, current evidence favors in\ufb02iximab or vedolizu- mab as the preferred \ufb01rst-line agents for moderate\u2013severe ulcerative colitis.

The first is vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the homing receptor \u03b14\u03b27 integrin complex, blocking the interaction of the surface homing molecules of activated immune cells with the endothelium to reduce diapedesis. The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These new agents have now proved their efficacy not only against placebo but also in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in specific indications (Sands et al., 2019, 2021; Irving et al., 2021). Consequently, they possess a comfortable market position compared to the historical anti-TNF agents, when not surpassing them for certain targeted groups of patients. However, striking efficacy differences have not been shown to support their superiority and anti-TNF agents remain the most appropriate medications in presence of most concomitant extraintestinal manifestations or in fistulizing CD (Juillerat et al., 2020; Papamichael et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021).\"\n\nThis text provides information on vedolizumab and ustekinumab, two biological drugs with different mechanisms of action that have shown efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC). It mentions that these drugs have been proven effective in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in specific indications.

A recent pooled analysis of 4 clinical trial programs (EXTEND, UNITY, VERSIFY, CPT-13 BIO-SIMILAR) was presented at ECCO congress 2022 and con\ufb01rmed that in\ufb02iximab achieved a higher proportion of 1-year endoscopic healing compared to adalimumab, ustekinumab and vedolizumab in CD patients, but not in bio-na\u00efve patients (Narula et al., 2022).\n\nAs second line therapy, it is also important to consider that the ef\ufb01cacy of vedolizumab will be in\ufb02uenced by previous anti-TNF exposure, a numerical difference was seen in the response to therapy in UC (Feagan et al., 2017) and CD patients (Sands et al., 2017).

During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to responders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R, and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T cells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019) when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have occurred.", "In older IBD patients, a protective effect against the development of severe adverse events have been demonstrated in UC when administering vedolizumab compared to anti-TNF agents (Cheng et al., 2021).

At this stage, we can thus consider all biological agents, when indicated, as safe in all populations.\n\nAlthough much fewer studies are available, remission rates observed with vedolizumab in elderly and pediatric population appear to match those reported in the general adult population (Asscher et al., 2020; Ibraheim et al., 2020).

Indeed, by virtue of its binding to \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, this antibody may not impede the entry of proin\ufb02ammatory cells in joints. In fact, it may even contribute to higher in\ufb02ux of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who observed de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated IBD patients (Diaz et al., 2020). An increased incidence of extra- intestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also been observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims database (Dubinsky et al., 2018).

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared these treatments with placebo or each other. The primary outcome was clinical remission at 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic remission, corticosteroid-free remission, and adverse events.\n\nResults: A total of 20 RCTs involving 5,000 patients were included in the analysis. The network meta-analysis showed that biological therapies, including anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab), vedolizumab, and ustekinumab, were more effective than placebo in achieving clinical remission at 52 weeks. Among the biological therapies, infliximab had the highest probability of being the most effective treatment. Small molecules, such as tofacitinib and filgotinib, also showed efficacy in achieving clinical remission.\n\nConclusion: Biological therapies, including anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab, are effective in achieving clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC.

The first is vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the homing receptor \u03b14\u03b27 integrin complex, blocking the interaction of the surface homing molecules of activated immune cells with the endothelium to reduce diapedesis. The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These new agents have now proved their efficacy not only against placebo but also in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in specific indications (Sands et al., 2019, 2021; Irving et al., 2021). Consequently, they possess a comfortable market position compared to the historical anti-TNF agents, when not surpassing them for certain targeted groups of patients. However, striking efficacy differences have not been shown to support their superiority and anti-TNF agents remain the most appropriate medications in presence of most concomitant extraintestinal manifestations or in fistulizing CD (Juillerat et al., 2020; Papamichael et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021).\"\n\nThis text provides information about vedolizumab, which is a biological therapy that has been used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. It mentions that vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of immune cells with the endothelium to reduce inflammation. However, it does not provide specific information about the use of vedolizumab in patients who have lost response to the drug.", "The relevant text from the document is as follows:\n\n\"The biological agents available for IBD treatment and their individual characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\"\n\n\"The \ufb01rst head to head published was the VARSITY trial (Sands et al., 2019). This trial, conducted over 1 year, compared 383 UC patients treated with vedolizumab to 386 UC patients treated with adalimumab. The primary outcome was reached. At week 52 the clinical remission rate (31.3% vs. 22.5%; P \u00bc 0.006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs. 27.7%; P < 0.001) was signi\ufb01cantly higher with vedolizumab compared to adalimumab.\"\n\n\"The SEAVUE study compared ustekinumab with adalimumab in 386 bio-na\u00efve patients with moderate to severe CD over 52 weeks. This study showed similar ef\ufb01cacy between the 2 groups at week 52: 65% in the ustekinumab group (n124/N191) vs. 61% in the adalimumab (n119/N195), p \u00bc 0.47. Interestingly, the rapidity of response was also similar between the two groups. The subanalyses re- ported a trend toward more safety, less use of concomitant steroids and a slightly better endoscopic response (particularly in patients with higher endoscopic scores at baseline) in the ustekinumab group.\"\n\nThese passages provide information on the comparative efficacy of vedolizumab and adalimumab in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, as well as the efficacy of ustekinumab compared to adalimumab in Crohn's disease. However, there is no specific information on the use of biological drugs in patients who have lost response to vedolizumab.", "In CD, a meta-analysis of 9 randomized trials with mixed \ufb01rst-line and second line indications con\ufb01rmed the superiority of in\ufb02iximab alone for induction (OR 2.8) or in combination with azathioprine for maintenance of remission (OR 3.0) (Hazlewood et al., 2015). A recent pooled analysis of 4 clinical trial programs (EXTEND, UNITY, VERSIFY, CPT-13 BIO-SIMILAR) was presented at ECCO congress 2022 and con\ufb01rmed that in\ufb02iximab achieved a higher proportion of 1-year endoscopic healing compared to adalimumab, ustekinumab and vedolizumab in CD patients, but not in bio-na\u00efve patients (Narula et al., 2022).\n\nAs second line therapy, it is also important to consider that the ef\ufb01cacy of vedolizumab will be in\ufb02uenced by previous anti-TNF exposure, a numerical difference was seen in the response to therapy in UC (Feagan et al., 2017) and CD patients (Sands et al., 2017). An impact which was clearly signi\ufb01cant at week 6 after induction (Sands et al., 2014).\n\nIn summary, the most recent meta-analysis in CD which included ustekinumab concluded that in\ufb02iximab or adalimumab are the best \ufb01rst-line agents, and ustekinumab a preferred second-line agent in patients with prior anti-TNF alpha agents\u2019 exposure (Singh et al., 2018b).\n\nThere is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD patients. During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to responders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R, and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T cells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019) when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have occurred.", "A pooled analysis of data from four randomized trials including 2257 UC patients reported that older patients have an increased baseline risk of adverse effects not related to anti-TNF therapy. In older IBD patients, a protective effect against the development of severe adverse events have been demonstrated in UC when administering vedolizumab compared to anti-TNF agents. Earlier publications also suggested a very good safety of anti-TNF agents in older populations. At this stage, we can thus consider all biological agents, when indicated, as safe in all populations.\n\nIn some large clinical trials, initiation of biologic therapy at a younger age was associated with better response, for example infliximab in both CD and UC patients. However, other studies did not find such an association as well as no differences in response according to gender. Although much fewer studies are available, remission rates observed with vedolizumab in elderly and pediatric population appear to match those reported in the general adult population. The same observations were also made for ustekinumab.\n\nObesity may contribute to the development and to the course of IBD through altered pharmacokinetics and obesity-mediated chronic inflammation. However, it remains unclear whether obesity influences response to biological therapies. On the one hand, a recent meta-analysis observed a higher rate of treatment failure in UC patients with higher BMI. On the other hand, other reports failed to find an association between BMI and treatment response in IBD. At this stage, there is little data on the impact of BMI on the response to vedolizumab or ustekinumab in IBD.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is relevant to consider the use of anti-TNF agents or vedolizumab in the treatment of the patient with severe ulcerative colitis who has lost response to vedolizumab. The safety of these biological agents in older populations has been demonstrated, and age does not appear to be a factor in treatment response. The impact of obesity on treatment response is unclear, but it may be worth considering in the case of this patient.", "Relevant text:\n\"Only two studies investigated the direct effect of biological agents on sarcopenia: the \ufb01rst reported an improvement of quadriceps muscle volume and strength in CD patients after 25 weeks of in\ufb02iximab treatment (Subramaniam et al., 2015), whereas Csontos et al. observed that UC and CD patients on anti-TNF agents had an improve- ment in fat free mass index after 12 week already (Csontos et al., 2016).\"\n\n\"Short duration of disease has long been associated with better response to in\ufb02iximab as well as other anti-TNF agents. This was reported in the \ufb01rst pediatric randomized trial by Hyams et al., which yielded better response and remission rates than observed in adults with longer duration of disease. This observation later con\ufb01rmed in others pediatric studies (Hyams et al., 2007; Walters et al., 2014). Similarly, registration trials with adalimumab and certolizumab pegol, which strati\ufb01ed ac- cording to disease duration showed better responses in patients with shorter disease duration (Colombel et al., 2007; Schreiber et al., 2010). A large meta-analysis of 60168 CD patients, con\ufb01rmed and extended this observation for other biological therapies, including golimumab and vedolizumab (Ben-Horin et al., 2021). However, the same analyses, failed to show an association between disease duration and response in 30227 UC patients. Regarding vedolizumab, a retrospective analysis of the Swiss IBD cohort showed an impact of disease duration on response in UC but not in CD patients (Mader et al., 2021). Very limited data are available regarding ustekinumab in early CD. In a retrospective pediatric cohort, treated with ustekinumab, the rate of remission was 61.1% in patients despite prior anti-TNF failure, suggesting a high potential with this agent in early disease (Kim et al., 2021).\"\n\n\"Differentiation can also be made on the extension and location of disease which may have a direct impact on the response to biological treatment (Atreya and Siegmund, 2021). In a recent genetic association study, Cleynen et al. determined that the separation of IBD between ileal CD, colonic CD, and UC could be considered as a continuum of phenotypes, to which specific risk score could be applied (Cleynen et al., 2016). Concerning disease behavior, better results were obtained in CD with anti-TNF agents in patients with non-stricturing, non-penetrating disease (B1 according to the Montreal classification), as compared to stricturing disease (B2) or fistulizing disease (B3) (Moran et al., 2014; Bouhnik et al., 2018; Nunez-Gomez et al., 2018). In UC, only limited data are available to guide therapy of isolated proctitis with biological agents. In a national retrospective study in France, half of 104 patients with ulcerative proctitis achieved remission with various anti-TNF therapies and 60% achieved mucosal healing (Pineton de Chambrun et al., 2020). In a large retrospective single center cohort, clinical response to biological therapy (mostly infliximab) was obtained in 70% of 118 5-ASA refractory ulcerative proctitis patients, as compared to 11% with azathioprine (Dubois et al., 2020).\"\n\n\"Recent studies have linked the risk of antibody development against biologic therapies, in particular anti-TNF agents, to the HLA profile of patients (Sazonovs et al., 2020, 2021). The authors associated the carriage of the HLA-DQA1*05 allele, common to 40% of Europeans, with a higher rate of immunogenicity to infliximab and adalimumab. Although details of the evidence has been discussed, the same association was found in the ABIRISK consortium in autoimmune diseases (Hassler et al., 2020). Whether information on HLA allele carriage can be used prospectively to identify patients at risk of developing antibodies for a specific prospective intervention remains to be seen.\"\n\n\"Extraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and represent an important cause of morbidity and disability (Vavricka et al., 2011; Juillerat et al., 2020). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect 30% of patients. They include non-inflammatory joint pain as well as inflammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as spondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, infliximab and later the other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD patient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials in both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established efficacies in most rheumatological indications (Herfarth et al., 2002; Generini et al., 2004; Lofberg et al., 2012; Louis et al., 2018).\"\n\n\"Fistula development affects up to 50% of CD patients over 20 years of disease course. Half of these patients experience perianal fistula (Rub- bino et al., 2021). After surgical drainage of pelvic sepsis, medical therapy may be undertaken. Best results so far are obtained with anti-TNF agents. Among them, only infliximab has been evaluated in a large, dedicated placebo-randomized trial. Out of 366 patients who received induction with 5 mg/kg infliximab at Week 0, 2 and 6, 195 responders were randomized to maintenance therapy or placebo. At Week 54, 36% of infliximab treated patients had a complete absence of fistula against 19% in the placebo group (Sands et al., 2004). Regarding the other bi- ologicals, subanalyses of randomized trials showed effectiveness of adalimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab in fistula closure, however the patient numbers are limited. All the data regarding these studies are put in perspective in the previously cited AGA Technical Review (Singh et al., 2021).\"", "The relevant text for the given patient profile is as follows:\n\n\"Optimizing biologic therapy in IBD: how essential is therapeutic drug monitoring?\" - This article discusses the importance of therapeutic drug monitoring in achieving optimal outcomes with biologic therapy in IBD.

Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during maintenance.\n\nIndirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across advanced therapies.", "For over 20 years, biologics have been the mainstay of treatment for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). These biologics target specific inflammatory pathways and have shown efficacy in managing the disease. Some examples of biologics used in UC treatment include infliximab (INF), adalimumab (ADA), and golimumab (GOL). However, there are limitations to these treatments, including primary nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and the need for parenteral administration.\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs (SMDs) for the treatment of UC. These drugs can be orally administered and lack immunogenicity. Some examples of SMDs that have shown promise in UC treatment include tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), upadacitinib (UPA), and ozanimod (OZA). These drugs target the Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway or modulate the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P).\n\nIt is important to note that the comparative efficacy and safety of these advanced therapies for moderately to severely active UC are still being studied.

It is conceivable that because TNFa antagonists were the first class of medications to be approved, patients treated with adalimumab or golimumab in clinical trials generally had exposure to only a single TNFa antagonist; in contrast, in subsequent trials of vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and ustekinumab, a significant proportion of patients may have been exposed to 2 or more biologic agents before clinical trial intervention, and inherently may be difficult to treat. However, trials of ustekinumab were conducted following approval of vedolizumab, and a subset of patients in these trials failed multiple TNFa antagonists and vedolizumab, conceivably making it a more refractory patient population.

Additionally, it mentions the future of personalized medicine, which may include the use of biomarkers to guide treatment decisions. While this information is relevant to the overall management of UC, it does not specifically address the use of biological drugs in the treatment of moderate to severe UC.", "In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia, stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal disease in 25% of patients. At the other end of the spectrum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD. With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate severity and 10%\u201315% of patients can experience a severe course. In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these, disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis. The risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6% 10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased significantly during the last 6 decades. The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and waning, but the underlying systemic inflammation can lead to progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinal damage and risk of complications if not treated adequately. Complications associated with ongoing inflammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, fistulas, abscesses, and surgery, and those associated with UC include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and colorectal cancer. Other complications include anemia, nutritional deficiencies, loss of bone density, and progressive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inflammation is associated with growth impairment, risking permanent loss of height. Similar to other chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumulative damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be measured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index. The concordance between intestinal inflammation and symptoms can be limited, especially in CD. In a population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inflammation may precede formal diagnosis. The STRIDE recommendations, updated recently, are meant to target endoscopic healing, minimize disability, and restore quality of life and adequate growth in children, in addition to control of symptoms. Therefore, rather than a gradual \"step-up\" approach, in which treatment adjustment is based on the severity of symptoms, the recommended treat-to-target approach aims to achieve endoscopic healing and control of inflammation and involves early, aggressive treatment in appropriate patients. Delay in diagnosis is more common in CD than UC. Data from the Swiss IBD cohort demonstrate that CD diagnosis can be delayed in pediatric and adult patients by 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Adults were more likely to present with strictures and require bowel surgery. Furthermore, the duration of diagnostic delay has been associated with complications such as strictures and internal fistulae. In a study of adult CD patients in France, delay in diagnosis longer than 13 months was associated with higher risk of a major surgery. There is a significant increase in gastrointestinal symptoms before IBD diagnosis. In addition, patients who were diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome or depression were less likely to receive timely specialist referral, suggesting that delays in IBD diagnosis may be related to focusing on comorbid or inaccurate diagnoses. In a population-based study using data from the Danish registry, a significant increase in costs associated with health care services, prescription medicine, home care services, and labor productivity loss in the 10 years before IBD diagnosis. IBD and ongoing inflammation can lead to impairment of growth and pubertal development in children. Impaired linear growth may be the only presenting symptom of IBD in pediatric patients. Growth impairment is multifactorial in nature, representing the summation of nutritional deficiencies, altered eating habits, inflammatory cytokines, and corticosteroid use. Marked growth impairment at diagnosis is a poor prognostic sign. Furthermore, IBD patients exhibit \"catch up\" growth beyond the typically expected age for growth plate closure, suggesting that achieving remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for maximal growth potential. Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD complications are mitigated by early treatment and remission. In the long-term follow-up data from the CALM trial, patients with early CD who achieved deep remission, compared to those who did not, had a significantly lower risk of new fistulas, abscesses, hospitalization, or surgery for CD during a median 3 years' follow-up. Other CD studies have similarly demonstrated that early treatment is independently associated with a lower risk of complications.", "Relevant text:\n\"Appropriately risk-stratifying prognosis in patients recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strategies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features are associated with a more aggressive disease course with higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk patients, early control of inflammation with immune-modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppressive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the short- and long-term, and entail significant health care costs. Therefore, a consideration of risks, benefits, and alternatives is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the informed patient.\"", "In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease advised by the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers and prior use of biologics. Extensive colitis, deep ulcers, need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difficile, and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colectomy risk. Of note, disease extension from limited disease to extensive or pancolitis is associated with worse prognosis.", "There is no relevant information in the given text regarding the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs for a patient with a history of lymphoma.", "There is no relevant text in this portion of the document for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs.", "In the case of severe ulcerative colitis (UC), particularly in patients with high-risk features such as extensive disease or a history of lymphoma, the first choice of treatment would be a biologic drug. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) such as infliximab (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) have been shown to be superior to other therapies for moderate UC. Biosimilars of IFX are also approved as less expensive alternatives. Ustekinumab (UST) may be a consideration for risk-averse patients, as it has been associated with a lower risk of serious adverse events and infections. Vedolizumab (VDZ) and UST are effective first-line options with good safety profiles, especially in moderate UC limited to the colon and without high-risk features. It is important to note that the response to VDZ may be lower in patients who have been previously exposed to TNFis, while biologic-na\u00efve patients tend to have higher response rates. Ongoing head-to-head trials will provide further clarification on the positioning of biologics in UC treatment.", "Combination therapy of a biologic with IMM, best-studied with TNFi, is an important consideration in severe disease, especially penetrating or perianal disease. It is associated with improved outcomes, a decrease in loss of TNFi response, and fewer long-term complications. The mechanism of action may be due to decrease in immunogenicity and impact on drug level. Similar effects have not been seen with adding IMM to UST of VDZ therapy, possibly due to a lower role of immunogenicity in drug metabolism. For patients with perianal CD, a multidisciplinary approach with early referral to a colorectal surgeon is key to improved outcomes.", "In patients with severe UC requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for induction and maintenance of remission, with or without IMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was associated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes compared to IFX monotherapy. When using IFX as a monotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential for the colon to act as a \u201csink\u201d for drugs, we advocate for checking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing and detecting immunogenicity early along with other pharmacokinetic and safety-related variables. There is no clear benefit of concomitant mesalamine with biologic therapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to biologics. Some patients may present with acute severe UC where TNFi, cyclosporine, or subtotal colectomy followed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good initial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe UC is beyond the scope of this article.", "There is no relevant information in the given text regarding the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs for a patient with a history of lymphoma.", "There is no relevant information in the given text regarding the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs.", "There is no relevant text in this portion of the document for the treatment of a patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs.", "Unfortunately, there is no relevant information in the provided text regarding the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs for a patient with a history of lymphoma.", "Unfortunately, the provided portion of the document does not contain any specific information about the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis using biological drugs. It primarily focuses on the title, authors, affiliations, and abbreviations used in the study.", "The relevant text from the document is as follows:\n\n\"More recently, two additional biologicals, with different mechanisms of action, have complemented the IBD armamentarium. The first is vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the homing receptor \u03b14\u03b27 integrin complex, blocking the interaction of the surface homing molecules of activated immune cells with the endothelium to reduce diapedesis. The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These new agents have now proved their efficacy not only against placebo but also in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in specific indications (Sands et al., 2019, 2021; Irving et al., 2021). Consequently, they possess a comfortable market position compared to the historical anti-TNF agents, when not surpassing them for certain targeted groups of patients. However, striking efficacy differences have not been shown to support their superiority and anti-TNF agents remain the most appropriate medications in presence of most concomitant extraintestinal manifestations or in fistulizing CD (Juillerat et al., 2020; Papamichael et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021).\"\n\nBased on this information, vedolizumab and ustekinumab are two additional biologicals that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. However, it is important to note that anti-TNF agents (such as infliximab and adalimumab) are still considered the most appropriate medications for patients with concomitant extraintestinal manifestations or fistulizing Crohn's disease. Given the patient's history of lymphoma, it is important to consider the safety profile of these medications and consult with a gastroenterologist or specialist in IBD to determine the most appropriate treatment option.", "There is relevant information in the document regarding the comparative efficacy of available biological agents for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). The document mentions head-to-head trials that compare different drugs in the treatment of UC. One such trial, the VARSITY trial, compared vedolizumab to adalimumab in UC patients and found that vedolizumab had a higher clinical remission rate and endoscopic improvement compared to adalimumab. Another head-to-head trial, the SEAVUE study, compared ustekinumab with adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) and found similar efficacy between the two groups.\n\nAdditionally, the document mentions network meta-analyses that compare the efficacy of biologic agents against placebo when no head-to-head trials are available. These meta-analyses have shown that in na\u00efve UC patients, in\ufb02iximab and vedolizumab are more effective in inducing clinical response and maintaining remission compared to other regimens. There is also some evidence of the benefit of ustekinumab over adalimumab or vedolizumab after anti-TNF exposure in UC patients.\n\nOverall, this information suggests that vedolizumab, in\ufb02iximab, and ustekinumab may be effective options for the treatment of moderate to severe UC. However, it is important to consider the patient's history of lymphoma and consult with a gastroenterologist or specialist to determine the most appropriate treatment approach considering her medical history.", "There is no relevant information in the given text regarding the treatment of ulcerative colitis in patients with a history of lymphoma. It is important to consult with a gastroenterologist or specialist in inflammatory bowel disease to determine the most appropriate treatment options for this specific patient profile.", "The risk of specific biologic adverse events, such as infections or lymphomas, is higher in the elderly population (Sturm et al., 2017; Hruz et al., 2020). However, in older IBD patients, a protective effect against the development of severe adverse events has been demonstrated in UC when administering vedolizumab compared to anti-TNF agents (Cheng et al., 2021). Earlier publications also suggested a very good safety of anti-TNF agents in older populations (Bonovas et al., 2016). At this stage, we can consider all biological agents, when indicated, as safe in all populations.\n\nIn some large clinical trials, initiation of biologic therapy at a younger age was associated with better response, for example, infliximab in both CD and UC patients (Vermeire et al., 2002; Billiet et al., 2015). However, other studies did not find such an association as well as no differences in response according to gender (Ferrante et al., 2008; Sprakes et al., 2012; Arias et al., 2015; Iborra et al., 2017). Although fewer studies are available, remission rates observed with vedolizumab in elderly and pediatric populations appear to match those reported in the general adult population (Asscher et al., 2020; Ibraheim et al., 2020). The same observations were also made for ustekinumab (Asscher et al., 2020; Conrad and Kelsen, 2020; Gisbert and Chaparro, 2020).\n\nIt is unclear whether obesity influences response to biological therapies in IBD patients. Some studies have observed a higher rate of treatment failure in UC patients with higher BMI, while others have failed to find an association between BMI and treatment response in IBD (Dai et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2018d). There is little data on the impact of BMI on the response to vedolizumab or ustekinumab in IBD.\n\nGiven the patient's history of lymphoma, it is important to consider the risk of adverse events associated with biologic therapy. However, the specific risk in this patient population is not mentioned in the provided text.", "Return relevant text:\n\"Short duration of disease has long been associated with better response to in\ufb02iximab as well as other anti-TNF agents. This was reported in the \ufb01rst pediatric randomized trial by Hyams et al., which yielded better response and remission rates than observed in adults with longer duration of disease. This observation later con\ufb01rmed in others pediatric studies (Hyams et al., 2007; Walters et al., 2014). Similarly, registration trials with adalimumab and certolizumab pegol, which strati\ufb01ed ac- cording to disease duration showed better responses in patients with shorter disease duration (Colombel et al., 2007; Schreiber et al., 2010). A large meta-analysis of 60168 CD patients, con\ufb01rmed and extended this observation for other biological therapies, including golimumab and vedolizumab (Ben-Horin et al., 2021). However, the same analyses, failed to show an association between disease duration and response in 30227 UC patients. Regarding vedolizumab, a retrospective analysis of the Swiss IBD cohort showed an impact of disease duration on response in UC but not in CD patients (Mader et al., 2021). Very limited data are available regarding ustekinumab in early CD. In a retrospective pediatric cohort, treated with ustekinumab, the rate of remission was 61.1% in patients despite prior anti-TNF failure, suggesting a high potential with this agent in early disease (Kim et al., 2021).\"", "The relevant text for the treatment of the given patient profile using biological drugs is as follows:\n\n\"Bonovas, S., Lytras, T., Nikolopoulos, G., Peyrin-Biroulet, L., Danese, S., 2018.
