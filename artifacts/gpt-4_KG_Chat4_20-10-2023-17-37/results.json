[{"question": "40 year old male with newly diagnosed moderate UC and articular extraintestinal manifestations\n", "answer": "Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Adalimumab.\n\n1. Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets the gut and has fewer systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective for both induction and maintenance therapy in moderate to severe UC. It also has a good safety profile, ranking low for serious adverse events.\n   - Disadvantages: While Vedolizumab is effective for UC, it may not be as effective for managing extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, such as articular manifestations, due to its gut-selective action. \n\n2. Adalimumab:\n   - Advantages: Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that works systemically, so it can help manage both the UC and the articular extraintestinal manifestations. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.\n   - Disadvantages: Adalimumab, being a systemic treatment, may have more potential for systemic side effects compared to gut-selective treatments. It also requires subcutaneous administration, which some patients may find inconvenient or uncomfortable.\n\nIt's important to discuss these options with the patient, considering their personal preferences, lifestyle, and willingness to self-administer injections if considering Adalimumab.", "source_document": [{"text": "Vedolizumab\nGEMINI I24d(induction and\nmaintenance therapy)211 sites, 2008 \u20132012;\nP(i): 149;\nI(i): VDZ 300 mg, wk 0, 2 \u2013746\nP(m):\nI(m):MCS /C202; wk 6(i);\nwk 52(M)P: 41 (13); 62\nI: 40 (13); 58\nP(m): 40 (14); 55\nI(m): 41 (13); 577.1 (7.2); 46\n6.8 (6.2); 507.8 (7.0); 506.2 (5.0); 4329.5\n35.4\n403656.3\n53.2\n5757NR\nNR49\ne\n48e\n37f\n42f\nMotoya et al25(induction and\nmaintenance therapy)100 sites, 2014 \u20132018;\nP(i): 82;\nI(i): VDZ 300 mg, wk 0, 2, 6 \u2013164\nP(m): 42\nI(m): VDZ 300 mg q8w; 41MCS /C202; wk\n10(i); wk60(m)P(i): 44 (16); 67\nI(i): 42 (14); 60\nP(m): 43 (14); 55\nI(m): 43 (14); 518.6 (8.0); 62\n7.2 (6.2); 628.7 (7.0); 55\n8.6 (7.8); 6852.5\n48.850.0\n53.830.5\n31.735.7\n31.8>3 mg/L: 39\n>3 mg/L: 54\nNR50\ng\n51g\n33h\n42h\nVARSITYa(induction and\nmaintenance therapy)245 sites, 2015 \u20132019;\nADA 160/80/40, wk 0, 2, 4 then\nq2w; 386\nVDZ 300 mg, wk 0, 2, 6, then q8w \u2013\n383MCS /C202; wk 14 ADA: 41 (13); 56\nVDZ: 41 (14); 616.4 (6.0); NR\n7.3 (7.2); NR25.9\n26.236.3\n36.1NR 21i\n21i\nProportion of patients receiving both IM\nand CS not reported\nTofacitinib\nOCTAVE 126(induction\ntherapy)178 sites, 2012 \u20132015;\nP: 122\nI: tofacitinib 10 mg orally twice\ndaily, 476MCS /C202, with\nrectalbleeding\nscore 0; wk 8P: 42 (15); 63\nI: 41 (14); 586.0 (0.5 \u201336.2)\nb;5 4\n6.5 (0.3 \u201342.5)b;5 3NA 47.5\n45.04.7 (0.1 \u201382.5)b\n4.4 (0.1 \u2013\n208.4)b5353\nOCTAVE 2\n26(induction\ntherapy)182 sites, 2012 \u20132015;\nP: 112\nI: tofacitinib 10 mg orally twice\ndaily, 429MCS /C202, with\nrectalbleeding\nscore 0; wk 8P: 40 (13); 49\nI: 41 (14); 606.2 (0.4 \u201327.9)\nb;5 1\n6.0 (0.4 \u201339.4)b;4 9NA 49.1\n46.25.0 (0.2 \u2013\n205.1)b\n4.6 (0.2 \u2013\n156.0)b58\n58\nOCTAVE-Sustain26d\n(maintenance therapy)178 sites, 2012 \u20132015;\nP: 198\nI: tofacitinib 5 mg orally twice\ndaily, 198MCS /C202, with\nrectal\nbleeding\nscore 0; wk 8P: 43 (14); 59\nI: 42 (14); 527.2 (0.6 \u201342.7)b;5 5\n6.5 (0.6 \u201340.3)b;5 20\n050.5\n51.01.0 (0.1 \u201345.0)b\n0.7 (0.1 \u201333.7)b46.", "metadata": {"page_label": 5, "file_name": "PIIS1542356520300446.pdf"}}, {"text": "Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics\nThe International Organization for the Study of In \ufb02am-\nmatory Bowel Disease and the American GastroenterologicalAssociation (AGA) provide a framework for categorization ofCD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-riskgroups based on phenotype and other characteristics.\n59,60\nIn CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on\nendoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of\na\ufb01stula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of\nworse outcomes.59,60In a prospective population-based\ninception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetratingbehavior was associated with a higher risk of progression toperianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65 \u201312.03) and was a\nrisk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86 \u20138.67) and\nhospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00 \u20131.01).\n16Ileal and\nupper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-ease are also markers of severe disease.\n61Cigarette smoking\nis associated with complications and need for therapyescalation.\n61\nIn CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-\nquality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule ourperianal CD.

These canmake the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primarycare level. Danese et al\n34have proposed a Red Flags Index\nconsisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triageand identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timelymanner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunctto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stoolmarker of in \ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC /C2040mg/\ng carried a /C201% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.\n35Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index /C218a n d /\nor FC>250mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to100%.\n36Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectionalimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.We refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by theAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn \u2019sa n d\nColitis Organization, and British Society of Gastro-\nenterology.\n37\u201340\nRisk Strati \ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately risk-stratifying prognosis in patients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selectionof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initialpresentation can vary widely from limited and mild toextensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical featuresare associated with a more aggressive disease course withhigher risk of progression and complications. In higher-riskpatients, early control of in \ufb02ammation with immune-\nmodifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-\nsive therapies are associated with safety concerns in theshort- and long-term, and entail signi \ufb01cant health care costs.\nTherefore, a consideration of risks, bene \ufb01ts, and alternatives\nis key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for theinformed patient.\nIt is important to differentiate between disease activity\nand severity. Although the former refers to the burden ofin\ufb02ammation at any given point in time, the latter takes into\naccount the disease phenotype and course, and is helpful indetermining prognosis and predicting complications\n(Figure 1 ). For example, a patient with low disease activity\n(little to no symptoms and low in \ufb02ammatory markers) may\nactually have high severity (due to disease history orbehavior) increasing the risk for disease progression, andshould be managed more proactively and aggressively. We\nwill review predictors of IBD severity and activity.\nAge of In \ufb02ammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis\nNumerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis\nis tied to adverse outcomes in both CD and UC.41In CD,\nbeing diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associatedwith an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 \u2013\n3.6) of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, includinghigher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,and disease recurrence.\n42,43In UC, younger age at diagnosis\nis linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-rectal cancer.\n44,45There are con \ufb02icting data on the disease\ncourse in the very-early-onset IBD population of patientsdiagnosed before age 6 years, with studies reporting both\nsimilar and worse outcomes in very-early-onset IBD\ncompared to the general pediatric population.", "metadata": {"page_label": 3, "file_name": "agrawal.pdf"}}, {"text": "perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1 \u201310 years\nafter diagnosis.9In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,\nstricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianaldisease in 25% of patients.\n10At the other end of the spec-\ntrum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% ofindividuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an\nuncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.\n11\nWith respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate\nseverity and 10% \u201315% of patients can experience a severe\ncourse.12In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid\nlocation of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years offollow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.\n13The\nrisk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreasedsigni\ufb01cantly during the last 6 decades.\n14\nThe symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and\nwaning, but the underlying systemic in \ufb02ammation can lead\nto progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinaldamage and risk of complications if not treatedadequately.\n15Complications associated with ongoing\nin\ufb02ammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, \ufb01stulas,\nabscesses, and surgery,3,16and those associated with UC\ninclude loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, andcolorectal cancer.\n2,4,17Other complications include anemia,\nnutritional de \ufb01ciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-\nsive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent in \ufb02amma-\ntion is associated with growth impairment, risking\npermanent loss of height.18Similar to other chronic dis-\neases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can bemeasured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.\n19\nLimited Correlations Among In \ufb02ammation,\nSymptoms, and Complications\nThe concordance between intestinal in \ufb02ammation and\nsymptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21In a\npopulation-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patientswere found to have strictures and penetrating disease at thetime of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent in \ufb02am-\nmation may precede formal diagnosis.\n22The STRIDE\n(Selecting Therapeutic Targets in In \ufb02ammatory Bowel Dis-\nease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant totarget endoscopic healing, minimize disability, and restorequality of life and adequate growth in children, in addition\nto control of symptoms.\n23Therefore, rather than a gradual\n\u201cstep-up \u201dapproach, in which treatment adjustment is based\non the severity of symptoms, the recommended treat-to-target approach aims to achieve endoscopic healing andcontrol of in \ufb02ammation and involves early, aggressive\ntreatment in appropriate patients.\n23\nDelay in Diagnosis Leads to Adverse Outcomes\nDelay in diagnosis is more common in CD than UC\n(median delay, 7.6 months; interquartile range [IQR], 3.1 \u2013\n15.0 months and 3.3 months; IQR, 1.9 \u20137.3 months, respec-\ntively; P<.001).24Data from the Swiss IBD cohort\ndemonstrate that CD diagnosis can be delayed in pediatricand adult patients by 3 months (IQR, 1 \u20139 months) and 6\nmonths (IQR, 1 \u201324 months), respectively. Adults were more\nlikely to present with strictures ( P<.001) and require\nbowel surgery ( P<.001). Furthermore, the duration of\ndiagnostic delay has been associated with complicationssuch as strictures and internal \ufb01stulae.\n25In a study, of adult\nCD patients in France, delay in diagnosis longer than 13\nmonths was associated with higher risk of a major surgery(P\u00bc.05).\n26\nEvidence of Disease Activity Before Diagnosis\nThere is a signi \ufb01cant increase in gastrointestinal symp-\ntoms before IBD diagnosis (9.6% and 10.4% 5 years beforeCD and UC diagnosis, respectively, compared with 5.8% ofcontrols).", "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "agrawal.pdf"}}, {"text": "micronutrients in diet, as well as food additives, processing,\nand packaging.104Currently, there is no recommendation\nfor whole foods \u2013based management of IBD, but future\nstudies will delineate this further.\nEarly Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis\nIn UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or\ntopical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-trol of disease.\n38For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-\ntive options,105,106and may be better \ufb01rst-choice options\nthan TNFi, given safety pro \ufb01le. In the VARSITY trial, the only\nhead-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n \u00bc769), VDZ was supe-\nrior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;P\u00bc.006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P\n<.001) in moderate to severe UC.\n105In case VDZ or UST\nmay not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety pro \ufb01le.\n107\nThiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after\nweighing risks against bene \ufb01ts.64In patients with severe UC\nrequiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic forinduction and maintenance of remission, with or withoutIMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-\nciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes\ncompared to IFX monotherapy.\n108When using IFX as a\nmonotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potentialfor the colon to act as a \u201csink \u201dfor drugs, we advocate for\nchecking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosingand detecting immunogenicity early along with otherpharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.\n109There is no\nclear bene \ufb01t of concomitant mesalamine with biologic\ntherapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating tobiologics.\n110Some patients may present with acute severe\nUC where TNFi, cyclosporine, or subtotal colectomy\nfollowed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good\ninitial strategy; discussion of management of acute severeUC is beyond the scope of this article.\nTaking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into\nConsideration\nEIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30% \u201340% of\npatients.111,112In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs\nbefore IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration\nacross specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-gists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to\nprompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to\nallow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,but also to allow for consideration of both in the selection oftherapy, dose, and chronicity of treatment. For example, VDZ,which is gut-selective, is associated with an increased risk ofde novo or worsening EIM.\n114,115In patients with signi \ufb01cant\nsymptoms of EIM, one should weigh the potential bene \ufb01to f\nVDZ against another therapy, such as TNFi, that might morebroadly target gut and systemic in \ufb02ammation.\n116\nPredictors of Response to In \ufb02ammatory Bowel\nDisease Therapy\nThe number of therapeutic agents in the IBD arma-\nmentarium are numbered, and each agent has limitedef\ufb01cacy.

Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: VDZ has been shown to be superior to Adalimumab in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC. It has a good safety profile and is a gut-selective medication, which means it specifically targets the gut and spares other systems.\n   - Disadvantages: VDZ is associated with an increased risk of new or worsening extraintestinal manifestations. It may not be feasible due to payer preference.\n\n2. Infliximab:\n   - Advantages: IFX is an effective option with a good safety profile. It is the preferred biologic for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with severe UC requiring hospitalization.\n   - Disadvantages: There is a potential for the colon to act as a \u201csink\u201d for drugs, which means that drug concentrations should be checked early to ensure proper dosing and to detect immunogenicity early. \n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health, comorbidities, and preferences. \n\n[{\"drug_name\": \"Vedolizumab\", \"advantages\": \"Superior to Adalimumab in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC.

In the VARSITY trial, the only\nhead-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n \u00bc769), VDZ was supe-\nrior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;P\u00bc.006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P\n<.001) in moderate to severe UC.\n105In case VDZ or UST\nmay not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety pro \ufb01le.\n107\nThiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after\nweighing risks against bene \ufb01ts.64In patients with severe UC\nrequiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic forinduction and maintenance of remission, with or withoutIMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-\nciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes\ncompared to IFX monotherapy.\n108When using IFX as a\nmonotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potentialfor the colon to act as a \u201csink \u201dfor drugs, we advocate for\nchecking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosingand detecting immunogenicity early along with otherpharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.\n109There is no\nclear bene \ufb01t of concomitant mesalamine with biologic\ntherapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating tobiologics.\n110Some patients may present with acute severe\nUC where TNFi, cyclosporine, or subtotal colectomy\nfollowed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good\ninitial strategy; discussion of management of acute severeUC is beyond the scope of this article.\nTaking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into\nConsideration\nEIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30% \u201340% of\npatients.111,112In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs\nbefore IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration\nacross specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-gists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to\nprompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to\nallow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,but also to allow for consideration of both in the selection oftherapy, dose, and chronicity of treatment.

These canmake the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primarycare level. Danese et al\n34have proposed a Red Flags Index\nconsisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triageand identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timelymanner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunctto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stoolmarker of in \ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC /C2040mg/\ng carried a /C201% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.\n35Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index /C218a n d /\nor FC>250mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to100%.\n36Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectionalimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.We refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by theAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn \u2019sa n d\nColitis Organization, and British Society of Gastro-\nenterology.\n37\u201340\nRisk Strati \ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately risk-stratifying prognosis in patients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selectionof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initialpresentation can vary widely from limited and mild toextensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical featuresare associated with a more aggressive disease course withhigher risk of progression and complications. In higher-riskpatients, early control of in \ufb02ammation with immune-\nmodifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-\nsive therapies are associated with safety concerns in theshort- and long-term, and entail signi \ufb01cant health care costs.\nTherefore, a consideration of risks, bene \ufb01ts, and alternatives\nis key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for theinformed patient.\nIt is important to differentiate between disease activity\nand severity. Although the former refers to the burden ofin\ufb02ammation at any given point in time, the latter takes into\naccount the disease phenotype and course, and is helpful indetermining prognosis and predicting complications\n(Figure 1 ). For example, a patient with low disease activity\n(little to no symptoms and low in \ufb02ammatory markers) may\nactually have high severity (due to disease history orbehavior) increasing the risk for disease progression, andshould be managed more proactively and aggressively. We\nwill review predictors of IBD severity and activity.\nAge of In \ufb02ammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis\nNumerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis\nis tied to adverse outcomes in both CD and UC.41In CD,\nbeing diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associatedwith an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 \u2013\n3.6) of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, includinghigher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,and disease recurrence.\n42,43In UC, younger age at diagnosis\nis linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-rectal cancer.\n44,45There are con \ufb02icting data on the disease\ncourse in the very-early-onset IBD population of patientsdiagnosed before age 6 years, with studies reporting both\nsimilar and worse outcomes in very-early-onset IBD\ncompared to the general pediatric population.", "metadata": {"page_label": 3, "file_name": "agrawal.pdf"}}, {"text": "perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1 \u201310 years\nafter diagnosis.9In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,\nstricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianaldisease in 25% of patients.\n10At the other end of the spec-\ntrum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% ofindividuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an\nuncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.\n11\nWith respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate\nseverity and 10% \u201315% of patients can experience a severe\ncourse.12In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid\nlocation of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years offollow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.\n13The\nrisk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreasedsigni\ufb01cantly during the last 6 decades.\n14\nThe symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and\nwaning, but the underlying systemic in \ufb02ammation can lead\nto progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinaldamage and risk of complications if not treatedadequately.\n15Complications associated with ongoing\nin\ufb02ammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, \ufb01stulas,\nabscesses, and surgery,3,16and those associated with UC\ninclude loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, andcolorectal cancer.\n2,4,17Other complications include anemia,\nnutritional de \ufb01ciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-\nsive loss of quality of life.

Furthermore, the duration of\ndiagnostic delay has been associated with complicationssuch as strictures and internal \ufb01stulae.\n25In a study, of adult\nCD patients in France, delay in diagnosis longer than 13\nmonths was associated with higher risk of a major surgery(P\u00bc.05).\n26\nEvidence of Disease Activity Before Diagnosis\nThere is a signi \ufb01cant increase in gastrointestinal symp-\ntoms before IBD diagnosis (9.6% and 10.4% 5 years beforeCD and UC diagnosis, respectively, compared with 5.8% ofcontrols).", "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "agrawal.pdf"}}, {"text": "second-line (in patients with prior exposure to tumor\nnecrosis factor [TNF]- aantagonists) is a key knowl-\nedge gap.

As observed for clinical remission, our network meta-analysis found that both tofacitinib and ustekinumab were significantly superior to both vedolizumab and adalimumab for the induction of endoscopic improvement (moderate confidence; appendix p 27). Tofacitinib (SUCRA 0\u00b7936) and ustekinumab (0\u00b7851) ranked highest for the induction of endoscopic improvement in biologic-exposed patients (appendix p 26).\nOverall, seven studies reported rates of histo  logical \nremission (ie, VARSITY , UNIFI, True North, SELECTION, VISIBLE 1, LAUREL, and HICKORY) that could be compared. Results of our post-hoc, direct, pairwise meta-analysis for histological remission are shown in the appendix (p 28).\nDiscussion \nWe reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs of biologics and small molecule drugs (approved or in a late stage of development) for induction and maintenance treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics, except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and was notably superior for these outcomes to all other interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety, vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in terms of adverse events and serious adverse events, as previously observed by Singh and colleagues.\n13 \nUpadacitinib had the highest SUCRA for all adverse events, showing that its remarkable efficacy might come at a cost of more adverse events. Results regarding filgotinib\u2019s safety were puzzling: it had the second lowest SUCRA for all adverse events, but ranked third highest for serious adverse events among active interventions. Representing another novel finding of this study, tofacitinib and infliximab were ranked highest for the maintenance of steroid-free remission in randomised responders and treat-straight-through studies, respectively.\nOur study included RCTs evaluating infliximab, \nadalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, etrolizumab, tofacitinib, filgotinib, ozanimod, and upadacitinib. Evidence regarding the induction of clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, and safety outcomes from 29 studies was synthesised, and indirect comparisons between therapies were made. Since the most recent systematic review was published,\n13 a large amount of new \ndata involving novel compounds has become available. This sheer increase in the number of therapeutic options for ulcerative colitis makes frequent updates of indirect \ncomparisons useful in the clinical setting.The inflammatory bowel disease pipeline has shifted in \nthe past 5 years towards small molecule drugs, in an effort to overcome the intrinsic limitations of biological treatment: moderate efficacy, loss of \nresponse, immunogenicity, and parenteral adminis -\ntration. However, available data from RCTs of small molecule drugs show that they induce similar rates of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement to biologics.\n42 Moreover, safety concerns have arisen \nsurrounding the use of tofacitinib, especially regarding the potential risk of venous thromboembolism and herpes zoster infection. One meta-analysis found an increased risk of herpes zoster infection with the use of JAK inhibitors in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease.\n43 This adverse event could be easily prevented by \nappropriate vaccination. The same meta-analysis did not find an increased risk of venous thromboembolism with the use of JAK inhibitors, although, until further evidence becomes available, caution is advised when considering JAK inhibitors as treatment options, especially in patients with known risk factors for thrombosis.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

These canmake the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primarycare level. Danese et al\n34have proposed a Red Flags Index\nconsisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triageand identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timelymanner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunctto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stoolmarker of in \ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC /C2040mg/\ng carried a /C201% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.\n35Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index /C218a n d /\nor FC>250mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to100%.\n36Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectionalimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.We refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by theAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn \u2019sa n d\nColitis Organization, and British Society of Gastro-\nenterology.\n37\u201340\nRisk Strati \ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately risk-stratifying prognosis in patients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selectionof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initialpresentation can vary widely from limited and mild toextensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical featuresare associated with a more aggressive disease course withhigher risk of progression and complications. In higher-riskpatients, early control of in \ufb02ammation with immune-\nmodifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-\nsive therapies are associated with safety concerns in theshort- and long-term, and entail signi \ufb01cant health care costs.\nTherefore, a consideration of risks, bene \ufb01ts, and alternatives\nis key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for theinformed patient.\nIt is important to differentiate between disease activity\nand severity. Although the former refers to the burden ofin\ufb02ammation at any given point in time, the latter takes into\naccount the disease phenotype and course, and is helpful indetermining prognosis and predicting complications\n(Figure 1 ). For example, a patient with low disease activity\n(little to no symptoms and low in \ufb02ammatory markers) may\nactually have high severity (due to disease history orbehavior) increasing the risk for disease progression, andshould be managed more proactively and aggressively. We\nwill review predictors of IBD severity and activity.\nAge of In \ufb02ammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis\nNumerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis\nis tied to adverse outcomes in both CD and UC.41In CD,\nbeing diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associatedwith an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 \u2013\n3.6) of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, includinghigher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,and disease recurrence.\n42,43In UC, younger age at diagnosis\nis linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-rectal cancer.\n44,45There are con \ufb02icting data on the disease\ncourse in the very-early-onset IBD population of patientsdiagnosed before age 6 years, with studies reporting both\nsimilar and worse outcomes in very-early-onset IBD\ncompared to the general pediatric population.", "metadata": {"page_label": 3, "file_name": "agrawal.pdf"}}, {"text": "perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1 \u201310 years\nafter diagnosis.9In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,\nstricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianaldisease in 25% of patients.\n10At the other end of the spec-\ntrum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% ofindividuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an\nuncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.\n11\nWith respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate\nseverity and 10% \u201315% of patients can experience a severe\ncourse.12In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid\nlocation of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years offollow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.\n13The\nrisk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreasedsigni\ufb01cantly during the last 6 decades.\n14\nThe symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and\nwaning, but the underlying systemic in \ufb02ammation can lead\nto progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinaldamage and risk of complications if not treatedadequately.\n15Complications associated with ongoing\nin\ufb02ammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, \ufb01stulas,\nabscesses, and surgery,3,16and those associated with UC\ninclude loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, andcolorectal cancer.\n2,4,17Other complications include anemia,\nnutritional de \ufb01ciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-\nsive loss of quality of life.

diagnosed moderate UC with a background of congestive cardiac failure\n", "answer": "Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab. \n\n1. Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets the gut and spares the rest of the body from unnecessary immunosuppression. This makes it a safer option for patients with other comorbidities like congestive cardiac failure. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.\n   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to show effects compared to other biologics. It also requires intravenous administration, which might not be convenient for all patients.\n\n2. Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has a different mechanism of action compared to other biologics, targeting interleukin-12 and -23. This can be beneficial for patients who might not respond to other treatments. It can be administered subcutaneously after the initial intravenous dose.\n   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab might not be as effective as other biologics in some patients. It is also one of the newer drugs, so long-term safety data is not as robust as for other treatments. \n\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized, taking into account the patient's overall health, lifestyle, and preferences.", "source_document": [{"text": "The following differences in \noutcome definitions across the RCTs were observed: location \nof endoscopic reading (generally local in RCTs for biologics \nvs central in RCTs for SMDs), Mayo score type (all RCTs \nreported FMS except for TRUE NORTH which only re-\nported an adapted Mayo score [AMS] that excluded the PGA \nsubscore), treatment duration (6\u201310 weeks induction with \nmost RCTs at 8 weeks, and 42\u201354 weeks maintenance), and \nprior biologic experience (most studies defined experience \nusing exposure with some defining it using failure). Of note, \ninduction safety outcomes were assessed after 10 weeks in 2 \nRCTs (Japic CTI-060298 at 14 weeks and SELECTION at \n11 weeks) but were included to be able to assess INF and FIL \n(Appendix 5).\nOf the 14 included maintenance RCTs, 11 (GEMINI 1, \nNCT02039505, OCTAVE Sustain, PURSUIT-J, PURSUIT-M, \nSELECTION, SERENE-UC, TRUE NORTH, U-ACHIEVE, \nUNIFI, and VISIBLE 1) had RR designs and 3 (ACT-1, M10-\n447, and ULTRA-2) had TT designs. RR clinical response \nand remission were imputed for ACT-1 and ULTRA-2; no \nother imputation was performed due to lack of reported \ndata.

These canmake the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primarycare level. Danese et al\n34have proposed a Red Flags Index\nconsisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triageand identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timelymanner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunctto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stoolmarker of in \ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC /C2040mg/\ng carried a /C201% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.\n35Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index /C218a n d /\nor FC>250mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to100%.\n36Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectionalimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.We refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by theAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn \u2019sa n d\nColitis Organization, and British Society of Gastro-\nenterology.\n37\u201340\nRisk Strati \ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately risk-stratifying prognosis in patients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selectionof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initialpresentation can vary widely from limited and mild toextensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical featuresare associated with a more aggressive disease course withhigher risk of progression and complications. In higher-riskpatients, early control of in \ufb02ammation with immune-\nmodifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-\nsive therapies are associated with safety concerns in theshort- and long-term, and entail signi \ufb01cant health care costs.\nTherefore, a consideration of risks, bene \ufb01ts, and alternatives\nis key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for theinformed patient.\nIt is important to differentiate between disease activity\nand severity. Although the former refers to the burden ofin\ufb02ammation at any given point in time, the latter takes into\naccount the disease phenotype and course, and is helpful indetermining prognosis and predicting complications\n(Figure 1 ). For example, a patient with low disease activity\n(little to no symptoms and low in \ufb02ammatory markers) may\nactually have high severity (due to disease history orbehavior) increasing the risk for disease progression, andshould be managed more proactively and aggressively. We\nwill review predictors of IBD severity and activity.\nAge of In \ufb02ammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis\nNumerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis\nis tied to adverse outcomes in both CD and UC.41In CD,\nbeing diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associatedwith an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 \u2013\n3.6) of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, includinghigher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,and disease recurrence.\n42,43In UC, younger age at diagnosis\nis linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-rectal cancer.\n44,45There are con \ufb02icting data on the disease\ncourse in the very-early-onset IBD population of patientsdiagnosed before age 6 years, with studies reporting both\nsimilar and worse outcomes in very-early-onset IBD\ncompared to the general pediatric population.", "metadata": {"page_label": 3, "file_name": "agrawal.pdf"}}, {"text": "perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1 \u201310 years\nafter diagnosis.9In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,\nstricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianaldisease in 25% of patients.\n10At the other end of the spec-\ntrum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% ofindividuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an\nuncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.\n11\nWith respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate\nseverity and 10% \u201315% of patients can experience a severe\ncourse.12In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid\nlocation of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years offollow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.\n13The\nrisk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreasedsigni\ufb01cantly during the last 6 decades.\n14\nThe symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and\nwaning, but the underlying systemic in \ufb02ammation can lead\nto progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinaldamage and risk of complications if not treatedadequately.\n15Complications associated with ongoing\nin\ufb02ammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, \ufb01stulas,\nabscesses, and surgery,3,16and those associated with UC\ninclude loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, andcolorectal cancer.\n2,4,17Other complications include anemia,\nnutritional de \ufb01ciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-\nsive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent in \ufb02amma-\ntion is associated with growth impairment, risking\npermanent loss of height.18Similar to other chronic dis-\neases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can bemeasured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.\n19\nLimited Correlations Among In \ufb02ammation,\nSymptoms, and Complications\nThe concordance between intestinal in \ufb02ammation and\nsymptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21In a\npopulation-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patientswere found to have strictures and penetrating disease at thetime of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent in \ufb02am-\nmation may precede formal diagnosis.\n22The STRIDE\n(Selecting Therapeutic Targets in In \ufb02ammatory Bowel Dis-\nease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant totarget endoscopic healing, minimize disability, and restorequality of life and adequate growth in children, in addition\nto control of symptoms.\n23Therefore, rather than a gradual\n\u201cstep-up \u201dapproach, in which treatment adjustment is based\non the severity of symptoms, the recommended treat-to-target approach aims to achieve endoscopic healing andcontrol of in \ufb02ammation and involves early, aggressive\ntreatment in appropriate patients.\n23\nDelay in Diagnosis Leads to Adverse Outcomes\nDelay in diagnosis is more common in CD than UC\n(median delay, 7.6 months; interquartile range [IQR], 3.1 \u2013\n15.0 months and 3.3 months; IQR, 1.9 \u20137.3 months, respec-\ntively; P<.001).24Data from the Swiss IBD cohort\ndemonstrate that CD diagnosis can be delayed in pediatricand adult patients by 3 months (IQR, 1 \u20139 months) and 6\nmonths (IQR, 1 \u201324 months), respectively. Adults were more\nlikely to present with strictures ( P<.001) and require\nbowel surgery ( P<.001). Furthermore, the duration of\ndiagnostic delay has been associated with complicationssuch as strictures and internal \ufb01stulae.\n25In a study, of adult\nCD patients in France, delay in diagnosis longer than 13\nmonths was associated with higher risk of a major surgery(P\u00bc.05).\n26\nEvidence of Disease Activity Before Diagnosis\nThere is a signi \ufb01cant increase in gastrointestinal symp-\ntoms before IBD diagnosis (9.6% and 10.4% 5 years beforeCD and UC diagnosis, respectively, compared with 5.8% ofcontrols).", "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "agrawal.pdf"}}, {"text": "micronutrients in diet, as well as food additives, processing,\nand packaging.104Currently, there is no recommendation\nfor whole foods \u2013based management of IBD, but future\nstudies will delineate this further.\nEarly Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis\nIn UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or\ntopical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-trol of disease.\n38For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-\ntive options,105,106and may be better \ufb01rst-choice options\nthan TNFi, given safety pro \ufb01le. In the VARSITY trial, the only\nhead-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n \u00bc769), VDZ was supe-\nrior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;P\u00bc.006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P\n<.001) in moderate to severe UC.\n105In case VDZ or UST\nmay not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety pro \ufb01le.\n107\nThiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after\nweighing risks against bene \ufb01ts.64In patients with severe UC\nrequiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic forinduction and maintenance of remission, with or withoutIMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-\nciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes\ncompared to IFX monotherapy.\n108When using IFX as a\nmonotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potentialfor the colon to act as a \u201csink \u201dfor drugs, we advocate for\nchecking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosingand detecting immunogenicity early along with otherpharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.\n109There is no\nclear bene \ufb01t of concomitant mesalamine with biologic\ntherapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating tobiologics.\n110Some patients may present with acute severe\nUC where TNFi, cyclosporine, or subtotal colectomy\nfollowed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good\ninitial strategy; discussion of management of acute severeUC is beyond the scope of this article.\nTaking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into\nConsideration\nEIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30% \u201340% of\npatients.111,112In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs\nbefore IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration\nacross specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-gists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to\nprompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to\nallow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,but also to allow for consideration of both in the selection oftherapy, dose, and chronicity of treatment. For example, VDZ,which is gut-selective, is associated with an increased risk ofde novo or worsening EIM.\n114,115In patients with signi \ufb01cant\nsymptoms of EIM, one should weigh the potential bene \ufb01to f\nVDZ against another therapy, such as TNFi, that might morebroadly target gut and systemic in \ufb02ammation.\n116\nPredictors of Response to In \ufb02ammatory Bowel\nDisease Therapy\nThe number of therapeutic agents in the IBD arma-\nmentarium are numbered, and each agent has limitedef\ufb01cacy.

These canmake the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primarycare level. Danese et al\n34have proposed a Red Flags Index\nconsisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triageand identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timelymanner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunctto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stoolmarker of in \ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC /C2040mg/\ng carried a /C201% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.\n35Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index /C218a n d /\nor FC>250mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to100%.\n36Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectionalimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.We refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by theAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn \u2019sa n d\nColitis Organization, and British Society of Gastro-\nenterology.\n37\u201340\nRisk Strati \ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately risk-stratifying prognosis in patients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selectionof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initialpresentation can vary widely from limited and mild toextensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical featuresare associated with a more aggressive disease course withhigher risk of progression and complications. In higher-riskpatients, early control of in \ufb02ammation with immune-\nmodifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-\nsive therapies are associated with safety concerns in theshort- and long-term, and entail signi \ufb01cant health care costs.\nTherefore, a consideration of risks, bene \ufb01ts, and alternatives\nis key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for theinformed patient.\nIt is important to differentiate between disease activity\nand severity. Although the former refers to the burden ofin\ufb02ammation at any given point in time, the latter takes into\naccount the disease phenotype and course, and is helpful indetermining prognosis and predicting complications\n(Figure 1 ). For example, a patient with low disease activity\n(little to no symptoms and low in \ufb02ammatory markers) may\nactually have high severity (due to disease history orbehavior) increasing the risk for disease progression, andshould be managed more proactively and aggressively. We\nwill review predictors of IBD severity and activity.\nAge of In \ufb02ammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis\nNumerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis\nis tied to adverse outcomes in both CD and UC.41In CD,\nbeing diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associatedwith an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 \u2013\n3.6) of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, includinghigher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,and disease recurrence.\n42,43In UC, younger age at diagnosis\nis linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-rectal cancer.\n44,45There are con \ufb02icting data on the disease\ncourse in the very-early-onset IBD population of patientsdiagnosed before age 6 years, with studies reporting both\nsimilar and worse outcomes in very-early-onset IBD\ncompared to the general pediatric population.", "metadata": {"page_label": 3, "file_name": "agrawal.pdf"}}, {"text": "perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1 \u201310 years\nafter diagnosis.9In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,\nstricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianaldisease in 25% of patients.\n10At the other end of the spec-\ntrum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% ofindividuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an\nuncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.\n11\nWith respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate\nseverity and 10% \u201315% of patients can experience a severe\ncourse.12In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid\nlocation of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years offollow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.\n13The\nrisk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreasedsigni\ufb01cantly during the last 6 decades.\n14\nThe symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and\nwaning, but the underlying systemic in \ufb02ammation can lead\nto progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinaldamage and risk of complications if not treatedadequately.\n15Complications associated with ongoing\nin\ufb02ammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, \ufb01stulas,\nabscesses, and surgery,3,16and those associated with UC\ninclude loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, andcolorectal cancer.\n2,4,17Other complications include anemia,\nnutritional de \ufb01ciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-\nsive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent in \ufb02amma-\ntion is associated with growth impairment, risking\npermanent loss of height.18Similar to other chronic dis-\neases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can bemeasured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.\n19\nLimited Correlations Among In \ufb02ammation,\nSymptoms, and Complications\nThe concordance between intestinal in \ufb02ammation and\nsymptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21In a\npopulation-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patientswere found to have strictures and penetrating disease at thetime of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent in \ufb02am-\nmation may precede formal diagnosis.\n22The STRIDE\n(Selecting Therapeutic Targets in In \ufb02ammatory Bowel Dis-\nease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant totarget endoscopic healing, minimize disability, and restorequality of life and adequate growth in children, in addition\nto control of symptoms.\n23Therefore, rather than a gradual\n\u201cstep-up \u201dapproach, in which treatment adjustment is based\non the severity of symptoms, the recommended treat-to-target approach aims to achieve endoscopic healing andcontrol of in \ufb02ammation and involves early, aggressive\ntreatment in appropriate patients.\n23\nDelay in Diagnosis Leads to Adverse Outcomes\nDelay in diagnosis is more common in CD than UC\n(median delay, 7.6 months; interquartile range [IQR], 3.1 \u2013\n15.0 months and 3.3 months; IQR, 1.9 \u20137.3 months, respec-\ntively; P<.001).24Data from the Swiss IBD cohort\ndemonstrate that CD diagnosis can be delayed in pediatricand adult patients by 3 months (IQR, 1 \u20139 months) and 6\nmonths (IQR, 1 \u201324 months), respectively. Adults were more\nlikely to present with strictures ( P<.001) and require\nbowel surgery ( P<.001). Furthermore, the duration of\ndiagnostic delay has been associated with complicationssuch as strictures and internal \ufb01stulae.\n25In a study, of adult\nCD patients in France, delay in diagnosis longer than 13\nmonths was associated with higher risk of a major surgery(P\u00bc.05).\n26\nEvidence of Disease Activity Before Diagnosis\nThere is a signi \ufb01cant increase in gastrointestinal symp-\ntoms before IBD diagnosis (9.6% and 10.4% 5 years beforeCD and UC diagnosis, respectively, compared with 5.8% ofcontrols).", "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "agrawal.pdf"}}, {"text": "micronutrients in diet, as well as food additives, processing,\nand packaging.104Currently, there is no recommendation\nfor whole foods \u2013based management of IBD, but future\nstudies will delineate this further.\nEarly Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis\nIn UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or\ntopical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-trol of disease.\n38For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-\ntive options,105,106and may be better \ufb01rst-choice options\nthan TNFi, given safety pro \ufb01le. In the VARSITY trial, the only\nhead-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n \u00bc769), VDZ was supe-\nrior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;P\u00bc.006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P\n<.001) in moderate to severe UC.\n105In case VDZ or UST\nmay not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety pro \ufb01le.\n107\nThiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after\nweighing risks against bene \ufb01ts.64In patients with severe UC\nrequiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic forinduction and maintenance of remission, with or withoutIMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-\nciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes\ncompared to IFX monotherapy.\n108When using IFX as a\nmonotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potentialfor the colon to act as a \u201csink \u201dfor drugs, we advocate for\nchecking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosingand detecting immunogenicity early along with otherpharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.\n109There is no\nclear bene \ufb01t of concomitant mesalamine with biologic\ntherapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating tobiologics.\n110Some patients may present with acute severe\nUC where TNFi, cyclosporine, or subtotal colectomy\nfollowed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good\ninitial strategy; discussion of management of acute severeUC is beyond the scope of this article.\nTaking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into\nConsideration\nEIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30% \u201340% of\npatients.111,112In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs\nbefore IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration\nacross specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-gists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to\nprompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to\nallow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,but also to allow for consideration of both in the selection oftherapy, dose, and chronicity of treatment. For example, VDZ,which is gut-selective, is associated with an increased risk ofde novo or worsening EIM.\n114,115In patients with signi \ufb01cant\nsymptoms of EIM, one should weigh the potential bene \ufb01to f\nVDZ against another therapy, such as TNFi, that might morebroadly target gut and systemic in \ufb02ammation.\n116\nPredictors of Response to In \ufb02ammatory Bowel\nDisease Therapy\nThe number of therapeutic agents in the IBD arma-\nmentarium are numbered, and each agent has limitedef\ufb01cacy.

The FMS consists of 4 items, each with \na subscore that ranges from 0 to 3 whole points: stool fre-\nquency subscore (SFS), rectal bleeding subscore (RBS), en-\ndoscopic Mayo subscore (EMS), and physician\u2019s global \nassessment (PGA).18 The efficacy outcomes analyzed by prior \nbiologic exposure were clinical response (decrease from base-\nline in FMS \u22653 points and \u226530%, accompanied by a decrease \nin RBS of \u22651 or an absolute RBS \u22641), clinical remission (FMS \n\u22642 with no subscore >1), and endoscopic improvement (EMS \n\u22641). Deviations from these definitions are noted in Appendix \n5. The safety outcomes analyzed in the overall populations \nwere all adverse events (AEs), discontinuation due to AEs, \nserious AEs, and serious infections, as reported in the RCT \npublications. Only outcomes evaluated during randomized, \ndouble-blinded phases were considered. Each binary outcome \nwas assessed after induction and maintenance, for a total \nof 20 NMAs conducted (ie, induction and maintenance of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/crohnscolitis360/article/5/2/otad009/7066911 by National University of Singapore user on 23 May 2023", "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "otad009.pdf"}}, {"text": "Burr et al.  10 of 45 \nfilter.

Studies included in these meta-\nanalyses were phase II or III randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to\nsevere ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6 \u201312,\nwith an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who wereeither treatment-na\u00efve ( \ufb01rst-line) or previously\nexposed to TNF aantagonists (second-line); (2) inter-\nvention: biologic therapy with in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab,\ngolimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,\nwith a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)comparator: another active intervention or placebo;\nand (4) outcome: induction of clinical remission (MayoClinic score of /C202 with no individual subscore of >1)\nand endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy sub-score of 0 or 1).\nBecause trials of maintenance therapy of biologic\nagents had different designs (treat straight-through\ndesign vs rerandomizing responders to induction ther-apy), we conducted separate pairwise and networkmeta-analyses for these different trial designs. Becausesafety is unlikely to be in \ufb02uenced signi \ufb01cantly by main-\ntenance therapy trial design, to inform comparativesafety, we conducted a single network meta-analysis ofall trials of maintenance therapy, regardless of different\ntrial design.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Other factors are involved in informed shared \ndecision-making \u2014 comorbid conditions, speed of onset of action and \na patient\u2019s values and preferences, such as the mode of administration, \ncost and access. In most jurisdictions, cost considerations upend these \ndiscussions, with a strong preference for using biosimilars for TNF antag -\nonists and conventional immunosuppressive agents like thiopurines \nand methotrexate in resource-limited settings (Fig.\u00a0 1).\nSimilar to Crohn\u2019s disease, there is a paucity of head-to-head clini -\ncal trials of advanced immunosuppressive therapies in patients with \nmoderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Integrating data from the VAR -\nSITY trial comparing vedolizumab versus adalimumab (Supplementary \nTable\u00a01) with data from phase II and III trials of approved therapies, \nnetwork meta-analyses suggest that upadacitinib, infliximab and ved -\nolizumab are probably the most efficacious therapies for induction \nof remission in patients who are biologic-naive, and are substantially \nmore effective than adalimumab5. In patients with prior exposure to \nTNF antagonists, upadacitinib is probably the most efficacious agent, \nmore effective than all other approved agents except ustekinumab. \nComparative safety studies suggest a lower risk of serious infections \nwith vedolizumab compared with TNF antagonists4. Based on the ORAL \nsurveillance study on the comparative safety of tofacitinib versus TNF \nantagonists in 4,362 older patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the US \nFood and Drug Administration issued an advisory limiting the use of \nall JAK inhibitors across all indications only to patients who have failed, \nor are intolerant to, TNF antagonists6 (Fig.\u00a0 1).\nThese indirect approaches, relying on network meta-analyses and \nobservational studies, have informed clinical guidelines to facilitate the \nmass personalization of therapy in routine clinical practice. However, \npersonalized medicine at an individual level remains unclear. For exam-\nple, which patient is at high risk of disease-related and treatment-related \ncomplications, which advanced immunosuppressive agent to choose, \nand in what order? Novel prognostic biomarkers and routine clinical fac -\ntors that predict disease course can help strike a balance between potent \nimmunosuppression and the risk of uncontrolled inflammation.

Immunomodulators (IMMs) may be a consider-ation in moderate disease nonresponsive to budesonide;\nhowever, long-term safety concerns limit this approach.\n60\nDue to lack of head-to-head trials, biologic positioning is\nreliant on indirect data, such as network meta-analyses andreal-world retrospective studies. In the former, the surfaceunder the cumulative ranking (SUCRA), a measure of therelative ranking of each treatment, is used for comparisons.SUCRA ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher number indicatinghigher ranking.

Available data on treatment sequences in algorithms and guidelines\nData from the literature on strategies to position biological therapy is\nscarce. Guidance and consensus statements exist to help aid the decision\nmaking process. However there is a tendency to position all biologics on\nthe same level and to consider them as interchangeable in the ECCO\nGuidelines ( Torres et al., 2020 ;Raine et al., 2021 ). These guidelines, used\nthe novel Grade methodology which prioritizes meta-analyses (or\nperform their own) to extract the necessary data to answer speci \ufb01c (so\ncall PICO) questions on IBD management (e.g. for anti-TNF agents in UC)\n(Raine et al., 2021 )).\nIn the most recent publication from the American Gastroenterology\nAssociation: \u201cTechnical Review, the Medical Management of Moderate toSevere Luminal and Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease \u201d, the question of\ncomparing the ef \ufb01cacy between all available biologics is addressed\n(Singh et al., 2021 ). The conclusion was that in biologic-na\u00efve patients\nwith moderate to severely active CD, in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab, and\nustekinumab are the most effective compared to vedolizumab and cer-\ntolizumab pegol. In \ufb02iximab was considered the strongest for induction.\nHowever, in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to in \ufb02iximab),\nthe bene \ufb01t of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain. A\nsummary of the ef \ufb01cacies of the various biological agents, according to\nthe line of treatment and previous treatment failures and patients'\nphenotype, is provided in Table 2 . The \ufb01nal word about the ef \ufb01cacy of\nbiologics in IBD and the theoretical \u201ctherapeutic ceiling \u201dwhich cannot be\nbroken ( Alsoud et al., 2021 ) could potentially come from combining\nthese agents such as demonstrated by the recent VEGA study. This 3-arm\ntrial presented as one of the highlights of the recent ECCO congress 2022,\ncompared golimumab (GOL), guselkumab (GUS) and their combined use\nduring induction period of 12 weeks. This showed a signi \ufb01cant higher\nrate of clinical response (83% for combination therapy vs. 75% for GUS\n(p\u00bc0.215) and 61% for GOL (p\n\u00bc0.003)) and clinical remission (47%\nfor combination therapy vs. 24% for GUS (p \u00bc0.005) and 25% for GOL\n(p\u00bc0.007) based on modi \ufb01ed Mayo score) without added risks for safety\nin moderate to severely active UC patients na\u00efve to biologics ( Sands et al.,\n2022 ).\n3. Personalizing choice of biologic\n3.1. Prior biologic exposure\nIn current clinical practice we are confronted with numerous options\nof treatment sequencing. Personalizing IBD treatment depends on pre-\nvious drug exposure IBD (1st, 2nd, 3rd line of treatment), prior treatment\nresponse, comorbidities, safety pro \ufb01le, patient preferences and patient\nrisk for future IBD complications (disease severity). For example, primary\nnon response to an anti-TNF was found to be a predictor for diminished\ntreatment ef \ufb01cacy with an anti-integrin biologic ( Singh et al., 2018c ).\nFirst and second line agent treatment sequences and treatment response\nhave been presented in the previous chapter. However, data are even\nscarcer concerning third line of treatment after two anti-TNFs exposure.\nA retrospective small series of 67 patients with Crohn's disease treated\nwith 3rd line anti-TNF agent ( Allez et al., 2010 ) reported a lower\nresponse rate and the lack of late responders at 6 months. A recent\nmulticenter retrospective study reported the outcome of patients with\nlate CD who had failed treatment with one anti-TNF agent and either\nvedolizumab or ustekinumab. After 48 weeks on a third line of biologic\ntherapy the remission rate was 30.7% whereas the surgery rate was\n23.5% ( Kassouri et al., 2020 ).", "metadata": {"page_label": 3, "file_name": "juillerat 2022.pdf"}}, {"text": "second-line (in patients with prior exposure to tumor\nnecrosis factor [TNF]- aantagonists) is a key knowl-\nedge gap. In the absence of head-to-head comparisons,prior network meta-analyses have attempted toaddress this gap, but have been limited by the number\nof studies, especially regarding comparative ef \ufb01cacy of\nagents in patients with prior exposure to TNF aantag-\nonists.\n4,5With the recent labeling and dosing change\nfor tofacitinib in light of safety considerations, recentpublication of a head-to-head trial comparing vedolizu-mab vs adalimumab in patients with moderate \u2013severe\nulcerative colitis, and recent regulatory approval ofustekinumab for these patients, the results of these an-\nalyses warrant updating.\n6,7\nHence, we updated our prior systematic review with\nnetwork meta-analyses, comparing the relative ef \ufb01cacy\nand safety of in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedo-\nlizumab, tofacitinib, and ustekinumab as \ufb01rst- and\nsecond-line agents in patients with moderate \u2013severe\nulcerative colitis.

Studies included in these meta-\nanalyses were phase II or III randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to\nsevere ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6 \u201312,\nwith an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who wereeither treatment-na\u00efve ( \ufb01rst-line) or previously\nexposed to TNF aantagonists (second-line); (2) inter-\nvention: biologic therapy with in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab,\ngolimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,\nwith a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)comparator: another active intervention or placebo;\nand (4) outcome: induction of clinical remission (MayoClinic score of /C202 with no individual subscore of >1)\nand endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy sub-score of 0 or 1).\nBecause trials of maintenance therapy of biologic\nagents had different designs (treat straight-through\ndesign vs rerandomizing responders to induction ther-apy), we conducted separate pairwise and networkmeta-analyses for these different trial designs. Becausesafety is unlikely to be in \ufb02uenced signi \ufb01cantly by main-\ntenance therapy trial design, to inform comparativesafety, we conducted a single network meta-analysis ofall trials of maintenance therapy, regardless of different\ntrial design.

From the SLR, to meet the \nstudy objectives and minimize between-study heterogeneity, a \nnarrower set of inclusion criteria was imposed for the NMA \nwhich is described in Table 1.\nOutcomes\nEfficacy outcomes based on the Full Mayo score (FMS) were \nassessed as possible. The FMS consists of 4 items, each with \na subscore that ranges from 0 to 3 whole points: stool fre-\nquency subscore (SFS), rectal bleeding subscore (RBS), en-\ndoscopic Mayo subscore (EMS), and physician\u2019s global \nassessment (PGA).18 The efficacy outcomes analyzed by prior \nbiologic exposure were clinical response (decrease from base-\nline in FMS \u22653 points and \u226530%, accompanied by a decrease \nin RBS of \u22651 or an absolute RBS \u22641), clinical remission (FMS \n\u22642 with no subscore >1), and endoscopic improvement (EMS \n\u22641).

Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and spares other systems. This could be beneficial for this patient who has a history of lymphoma, as it may reduce the risk of reactivating the lymphoma compared to systemic immunosuppressants.\n   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Vedolizumab is that it may take longer to work compared to other treatments. It also requires intravenous administration, which may be less convenient for some patients.\n\n2. Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for some patients.\n   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may increase the risk of infections. Given the patient's history of lymphoma, there may also be a potential risk of cancer recurrence, although this risk is thought to be low.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, including their disease severity, comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal preferences.

Other factors are involved in informed shared \ndecision-making \u2014 comorbid conditions, speed of onset of action and \na patient\u2019s values and preferences, such as the mode of administration, \ncost and access. In most jurisdictions, cost considerations upend these \ndiscussions, with a strong preference for using biosimilars for TNF antag -\nonists and conventional immunosuppressive agents like thiopurines \nand methotrexate in resource-limited settings (Fig.\u00a0 1).\nSimilar to Crohn\u2019s disease, there is a paucity of head-to-head clini -\ncal trials of advanced immunosuppressive therapies in patients with \nmoderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Integrating data from the VAR -\nSITY trial comparing vedolizumab versus adalimumab (Supplementary \nTable\u00a01) with data from phase II and III trials of approved therapies, \nnetwork meta-analyses suggest that upadacitinib, infliximab and ved -\nolizumab are probably the most efficacious therapies for induction \nof remission in patients who are biologic-naive, and are substantially \nmore effective than adalimumab5. In patients with prior exposure to \nTNF antagonists, upadacitinib is probably the most efficacious agent, \nmore effective than all other approved agents except ustekinumab. \nComparative safety studies suggest a lower risk of serious infections \nwith vedolizumab compared with TNF antagonists4.

Keyword searches of \nthe annual proceedings of relevant scientific meetings (from \nlast 4 years) and clinical trial registers (no date limit) were \nalso conducted for additional available data. Finally, the \nbibliographies of SLRs and meta-analyses identified through \ndatabase searches and selected key RCTs were reviewed to \nensure literature saturation. Details of the search strategy are \npresented in Appendix 1; the full SLR protocol has been reg-\nistered with PROSPERO.17\nStudy Selection\nTitle/abstract and full-text screenings were conducted sequen-\ntially and in parallel by 2 independent researchers to iden-\ntify studies that met the SLR eligibility criteria, which are \ndescribed in detail in Appendix 2. From the SLR, to meet the \nstudy objectives and minimize between-study heterogeneity, a \nnarrower set of inclusion criteria was imposed for the NMA \nwhich is described in Table 1.\nOutcomes\nEfficacy outcomes based on the Full Mayo score (FMS) were \nassessed as possible. The FMS consists of 4 items, each with \na subscore that ranges from 0 to 3 whole points: stool fre-\nquency subscore (SFS), rectal bleeding subscore (RBS), en-\ndoscopic Mayo subscore (EMS), and physician\u2019s global \nassessment (PGA).18 The efficacy outcomes analyzed by prior \nbiologic exposure were clinical response (decrease from base-\nline in FMS \u22653 points and \u226530%, accompanied by a decrease \nin RBS of \u22651 or an absolute RBS \u22641), clinical remission (FMS \n\u22642 with no subscore >1), and endoscopic improvement (EMS \n\u22641). Deviations from these definitions are noted in Appendix \n5. The safety outcomes analyzed in the overall populations \nwere all adverse events (AEs), discontinuation due to AEs, \nserious AEs, and serious infections, as reported in the RCT \npublications. Only outcomes evaluated during randomized, \ndouble-blinded phases were considered.

Safety oftofacitinib seems to be dose-dependent, and in instancesin which a higher 10-mg twice-per-day dose of tofacitinib\nis used for long-term maintenance, safety concerns\nshould be discussed adequately with patients.\nIntegrating \ufb01ndings from this meta-analysis and other\nstudies, current evidence favors in \ufb02iximab or vedolizu-\nmab as the preferred \ufb01rst-line agents for\nmoderate \u2013severe ulcerative colitis.

response to Infliximab due to antibody formation. This suggests that the patient has had prior exposure to Anti-TNF agents and has failed to respond to Infliximab.\n\nGiven this context, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient would be Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab.\n\n1. Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been ranked highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement. It has a different mechanism of action, targeting interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23, which might be beneficial for patients who have developed antibodies to Anti-TNF agents.\n   - Disadvantages: The long-term safety profile of Ustekinumab is not as well established as that of Anti-TNF agents. There may also be a higher cost associated with this drug compared to others.\n\n2. Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is another option for patients who have had prior exposure to TNF antagonists. It works by blocking the interaction of the surface homing molecules of activated immune cells with the endothelium to reduce diapedesis. It has a good safety profile and is generally well tolerated.\n   - Disadvantages: The response to Vedolizumab is lower among TNFi exposed patients. It may also take longer to see a response with Vedolizumab compared to other treatments.\n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, preferences, and potential side effects of the drugs. It is also important to consider the cost and availability of these drugs. \n\n[{\"drug_name\": \"Ustekinumab\", \"advantages\": \"Ranked highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement.

Immunomodulators (IMMs) may be a consider-ation in moderate disease nonresponsive to budesonide;\nhowever, long-term safety concerns limit this approach.\n60\nDue to lack of head-to-head trials, biologic positioning is\nreliant on indirect data, such as network meta-analyses andreal-world retrospective studies. In the former, the surfaceunder the cumulative ranking (SUCRA), a measure of therelative ranking of each treatment, is used for comparisons.SUCRA ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher number indicatinghigher ranking. For the management of early moderate tosevere CD, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) remainthe mainstay of treatment. In a network meta-analysis ofrandomized controlled trial data,\n87in\ufb02iximab (IFX) and\nadalimumab (ADA) were superior to other therapies for\nmoderate CD (SUCRA 0.93 and 0.75, respectively). Of note,biosimilars are approved as inexpensive alternatives to\nIFX.88Ustekinumab (UST) was associated with a lower risk\nof serious adverse events and infections (SUCRA 0.72 and0.71, respectively), and may be a consideration among risk-averse patients. In moderate CD, especially when limited tothe colon and no high-risk features, vedolizumab (VDZ) andUST are ef \ufb01cacious \ufb01rst-line options with good safety\npro\ufb01les. In addition, although response to VDZ is lower\namong TNFi exposed, biologic-na\u00efve patients have higherrates of response. Results from ongoing head-to-head trialssuch as UST vs adalimumab ( ClinicalTrials.gov ID:\nNCT03464136) and risankizumab vs UST ( ClinicalTrials.\ngov ID: NCT04524611) will help clarify the positioning of\nbiologics.\nIn the case of severe CD, or when particularly high-risk\nfeatures, such as \ufb01stulizing or stricturing disease, or prox-\nimal involvement, a TNFi, particularly IFX, remains the \ufb01rst\nchoice.

These guidelines, used\nthe novel Grade methodology which prioritizes meta-analyses (or\nperform their own) to extract the necessary data to answer speci \ufb01c (so\ncall PICO) questions on IBD management (e.g. for anti-TNF agents in UC)\n(Raine et al., 2021 )).\nIn the most recent publication from the American Gastroenterology\nAssociation: \u201cTechnical Review, the Medical Management of Moderate toSevere Luminal and Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease \u201d, the question of\ncomparing the ef \ufb01cacy between all available biologics is addressed\n(Singh et al., 2021 ). The conclusion was that in biologic-na\u00efve patients\nwith moderate to severely active CD, in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab, and\nustekinumab are the most effective compared to vedolizumab and cer-\ntolizumab pegol. In \ufb02iximab was considered the strongest for induction.\nHowever, in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to in \ufb02iximab),\nthe bene \ufb01t of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain. A\nsummary of the ef \ufb01cacies of the various biological agents, according to\nthe line of treatment and previous treatment failures and patients'\nphenotype, is provided in Table 2 . The \ufb01nal word about the ef \ufb01cacy of\nbiologics in IBD and the theoretical \u201ctherapeutic ceiling \u201dwhich cannot be\nbroken ( Alsoud et al., 2021 ) could potentially come from combining\nthese agents such as demonstrated by the recent VEGA study. This 3-arm\ntrial presented as one of the highlights of the recent ECCO congress 2022,\ncompared golimumab (GOL), guselkumab (GUS) and their combined use\nduring induction period of 12 weeks. This showed a signi \ufb01cant higher\nrate of clinical response (83% for combination therapy vs. 75% for GUS\n(p\u00bc0.215) and 61% for GOL (p\n\u00bc0.003)) and clinical remission (47%\nfor combination therapy vs. 24% for GUS (p \u00bc0.005) and 25% for GOL\n(p\u00bc0.007) based on modi \ufb01ed Mayo score) without added risks for safety\nin moderate to severely active UC patients na\u00efve to biologics ( Sands et al.,\n2022 ).\n3. Personalizing choice of biologic\n3.1. Prior biologic exposure\nIn current clinical practice we are confronted with numerous options\nof treatment sequencing. Personalizing IBD treatment depends on pre-\nvious drug exposure IBD (1st, 2nd, 3rd line of treatment), prior treatment\nresponse, comorbidities, safety pro \ufb01le, patient preferences and patient\nrisk for future IBD complications (disease severity). For example, primary\nnon response to an anti-TNF was found to be a predictor for diminished\ntreatment ef \ufb01cacy with an anti-integrin biologic ( Singh et al., 2018c ).\nFirst and second line agent treatment sequences and treatment response\nhave been presented in the previous chapter. However, data are even\nscarcer concerning third line of treatment after two anti-TNFs exposure.\nA retrospective small series of 67 patients with Crohn's disease treated\nwith 3rd line anti-TNF agent ( Allez et al., 2010 ) reported a lower\nresponse rate and the lack of late responders at 6 months. A recent\nmulticenter retrospective study reported the outcome of patients with\nlate CD who had failed treatment with one anti-TNF agent and either\nvedolizumab or ustekinumab. After 48 weeks on a third line of biologic\ntherapy the remission rate was 30.7% whereas the surgery rate was\n23.5% ( Kassouri et al., 2020 ).", "metadata": {"page_label": 3, "file_name": "juillerat 2022.pdf"}}, {"text": "Combination therapy of a biologic with IMM, best-\nstudied with TNFi, is an important consideration in severedisease, especially penetrating or perianal disease.

As a result of this\nvast landscape of treatment, positioning advanced therapies (according to clinical situation, ef \ufb01cacy and safety) is\nof paramount importance to providing personalized, appropriate IBD treatment.\nIn this publication the recent available literature is summarized for practical integration into clinical practice\nincluding comparative ef \ufb01cacy data, patient and disease demographics. We refer to recent publications and expert\nopinion in order to facilitate the decision making process of positioning biologicals IBD treatment.\n1. Introduction\nBiological therapies have revolutionized the management of in \ufb02am-\nmatory bowel diseases (IBD). Monoclonal antibodies against tumor ne-\ncrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) have been the cornerstone of IBD therapy\nsince the start of the century. In 1998, in \ufb02iximab was the \ufb01rst biological\nmedication approved for the use of Crohn's disease (CD), followed by\nadalimumab. Numerous studies have demonstrated their ef \ufb01cacy and\ncost effectiveness for the induction and maintenance of remission in CD\n(Townsend et al., 2020 ) and ulcerative colitis (UC) ( Colombel et al.,\n2007 ;Pantavou et al., 2019 ). Golimumab for UC ( Sandborn et al., 2014 )\nand Certolizumab pegol for CD ( Schreiber et al., 2010 ;Yamazaki et al.,\n2019 ) are other anti-TNF inhibitors that are currently available. After\nover 20 years of experience of prescribing anti-TNF agents, their safety\npro\ufb01le has been well described and dose optimization has been incor-\nporated into daily clinical practice although proactive monitoring re-\nmains a question of debate ( Argollo et al., 2020 ).\nMore recently, two additional biologicals, with different mechanisms\nof action, have complemented the IBD armamentarium. The \ufb01rst is\nvedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the homing receptor\n\u03b14\u03b27 integrin complex, blocking the interaction of the surface homing\nmolecules of activated immune cells with the endothelium to reduce\ndiapedesis. The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonalantibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These\nnew agents have now proved their ef \ufb01cacy not only against placebo but\nalso in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in speci \ufb01c indications\n(Sands et al., 2019 ,2021 ;Irving et al., 2021 ). Consequently, they possess\na comfortable market position compared to the historical anti-TNF\nagents, when not surpassing them for certain targeted groups of pa-\ntients. However, striking ef \ufb01cacy differences have not been shown to\nsupport their superiority and anti-TNF agents remain the most appro-\npriate medications in presence of most concomitant extraintestinal\nmanifestations or in \ufb01stulizing CD ( Juillerat et al., 2020 ;Papamichael\net al., 2021 ;Singh et al., 2021 ).", "metadata": {"page_label": 1, "file_name": "juillerat 2022.pdf"}}, {"text": "Upadacitinib was significantly superior to all other interventions for the induction of clinical \nremission (infliximab [OR 2\u00b770, 95% CI 1\u00b718\u20136\u00b720], adalimumab [4\u00b764, 2\u00b747\u20138\u00b771], golimumab [3\u00b700, 1\u00b732\u20136\u00b782], vedolizumab [3\u00b756, 1\u00b784\u20136\u00b791], ustekinumab [2\u00b792, 1\u00b731\u20136\u00b751], etrolizumab [4\u00b791, 2\u00b759\u20139\u00b731], tofacitinib [2\u00b784, 1\u00b728\u20136\u00b731], filgotinib 100 mg [6\u00b715, 2\u00b798\u201312\u00b772], filgotinib 200 mg [4\u00b749, 2\u00b718\u20139\u00b724], and ozanimod (2\u00b770, 1\u00b718\u20136\u00b720), and ranked highest for the induction of clinical remission (SUCRA 0\u00b7996).

Biologics with other targets were later approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, \nnamely vedolizumab and, more recently, usteki  numab. \nHowever, treatment with biologics

It is also effective in treating extraintestinal manifestations, including rheumatological manifestations, which is relevant for this patient with rheumatoid arthritis.\n   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. There may also be risks associated with its use, including potentially serious adverse effects. Some patients may develop antibodies against Infliximab, reducing its effectiveness.\n\n2. Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been tested and shown efficacy in the treatment of UC. It is also indicated in rheumatoid arthritis, making it a suitable choice for this patient. It acts against other pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC.\n   - Disadvantages: The exact efficacy range of Ustekinumab varies, and it may not work in all patients. As with Infliximab, Ustekinumab is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. \n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized, considering the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential risks.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "Till then our best options for pouchitis refractory to antibiotics were\nmostly anti-TNF agents but without very high level of evidence ( Kayal\nand Dubinsky, 2022 ): only one randomized controlled trial with adali-\nmumab ( Kj\u00e6r et al., 2019 ).\nRecent studies have linked the risk of antibody development against\nbiologic therapies, in particular anti-TNF agents, to the HLA pro \ufb01le of\npatients ( Sazonovs et al., 2020 ,2021 ). The authors associated the car-\nriage of the HLA-DQA1*05 allele, common to 40% of Europeans, with a\nhigher rate of immunogenicity to in \ufb02iximab and adalimumab. Although\ndetails of the evidence has been discussed, the same association was\nfound in the ABIRISK consortium in autoimmune diseases ( Hassler et al.,\n2020 ). Whether information on HLA allele carriage can be used pro-\nspectively to identify patients at risk of developing antibodies for a spe-\nci\ufb01c prospective intervention remains to be seen.Although the serological biomarkers ASCA and pANCA have long\nbeen used to help classify indeterminate colitis, their value in guiding\nmedical therapy is still limited. A recent study associated presence of\nASCA with extensive and severe disease phenotype and the need for an\nearly use of biologics for a better prognosis in a cohort of 273 CD pedi-\natric patients ( Chandrakumar et al., 2019 ), whereas a meta-analysis\nfound that pANCA positive IBD patients had a lower response rate to\nin\ufb02iximab therapy ( Nguyen et al., 2015 ).\nExtraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and\nrepresent an important cause of morbidity and disability ( Vavricka et al.,\n2011 ;Juillerat et al., 2020 ). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect\n30% of patients. They include non-in \ufb02ammatory joint pain as well as\nin\ufb02ammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as\nspondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, in \ufb02iximab and later\nthe other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD\npatient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials\nin both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established ef \ufb01cacies in most\nrheumatological indications ( Herfarth et al., 2002 ;Generini et al., 2004 ;\nLofberg et al., 2012 ;Louis et al., 2018 ).\nVedolizumab may not represent the most appropriate biologic in\npresence of articular manifestations of IBD. Indeed, by virtue of its\nbinding to \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, this antibody may not impede the entry of\nproin \ufb02ammatory cells in joints. In fact, it may even contribute to higher\nin\ufb02ux of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who\nobserved de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated\nIBD patients ( Diaz et al., 2020 ). An increased incidence of extra-\nintestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also\nbeen observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims\ndatabase ( Dubinsky et al., 2018 ). However, by improving disease activity\nthese drugs could still have an indirect impact on associated EIM, mostly\nperipheral arthritis, as suggested by the recent EMOTIVE retrospective\nanalysis ( Kopylov et al., 2021 ). Ustekinumab, however, has also limited\nrole in this indication, as this drug is also indicated in rheumatoid\narthritis ( Kerschbaumer et al., 2020 ). Dermatological extraintestinal\nmanifestations occur in up to 15% of IBD patients ( Vavricka et al., 2011 ).\nThe most common, erythema nodosum, depends on the underlying dis-\nease activity, whereas pyoderma gangrenosum may be associated with\nactive or inactive intestinal disease and requires rapid management, most\ncommonly with systemic medication. Treatment includes oral cortico-\nsteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and anti-TNF therapy (in \ufb02iximab or\nadalimumab), drugs that have good ef \ufb01cacy in several cases reports and\nsmall case series ( Juillerat et al., 2007 ).", "metadata": {"page_label": 5, "file_name": "juillerat 2022.pdf"}}, {"text": "second-line (in patients with prior exposure to tumor\nnecrosis factor [TNF]- aantagonists) is a key knowl-\nedge gap.

Studies included in these meta-\nanalyses were phase II or III randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to\nsevere ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6 \u201312,\nwith an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who wereeither treatment-na\u00efve ( \ufb01rst-line) or previously\nexposed to TNF aantagonists (second-line); (2) inter-\nvention: biologic therapy with in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab,\ngolimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,\nwith a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)comparator: another active intervention or placebo;\nand (4) outcome: induction of clinical remission (MayoClinic score of /C202 with no individual subscore of >1)\nand endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy sub-score of 0 or 1).\nBecause trials of maintenance therapy of biologic\nagents had different designs (treat straight-through\ndesign vs rerandomizing responders to induction ther-apy), we conducted separate pairwise and networkmeta-analyses for these different trial designs. Becausesafety is unlikely to be in \ufb02uenced signi \ufb01cantly by main-\ntenance therapy trial design, to inform comparativesafety, we conducted a single network meta-analysis ofall trials of maintenance therapy, regardless of different\ntrial design. Detailed inclusion criteria for trials of\nmaintenance therapy and exclusion criteria are listed intheSupplementary Appendix .\nSearch Strategy, Data Abstraction, and Risk of\nBias Assessment\nWe updated our previous literature search, conduct-\ned as part the American Gastroenterological Association\ntechnical review on management of moderate \u2013severe\nulcerative colitis (date of search, March 30, 2018), onSeptember 30, 2019, with no language restrictions. De-tails of the search strategy are shown in theSupplementary Appendix . Data on study-, participant-,\ndisease-, and treatment-related characteristics wereabstracted onto a standardized form by 2 investigators\nindependently (S.S. and M.F.", "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "PIIS1542356520300446.pdf"}}, {"text": "First, consistent with prior published NMAs, we \nconducted separate NMAs for induction and maintenance \ntreatments.11,12 Then, rather than burdening medical decision \nmakers with the task of reconciling results from disparate \nanalyses of induction and maintenance, we took the novel \nadditional step to combine induction and maintenance NMA \nresults to simulate absolute treatment efficacy in an intent-\nto-treat (ITT) population of induction responders in an RR \nmaintenance RCT.\nMaterials and Methods\nSearch Strategy\nA clinical SLR was conducted per guidance from the Cochrane \nHandbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,13 Centre \nfor Reviews and Dissemination\u2019s Guidance for Undertaking \nReviews in Healthcare,14 and Methods for the Development \nof National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) \nPublic Health Guidance.15 Using the Ovid platform,16 searches \nfor English-language publications of RCTs reporting the clin-\nical efficacy and/or safety of relevant treatments for adults with \nmoderately to severely active UC were conducted on January \n6, 2022 (from inception of the databases) in MEDLINE, \nEmbase, and other relevant databases. Keyword searches of \nthe annual proceedings of relevant scientific meetings (from \nlast 4 years) and clinical trial registers (no date limit) were \nalso conducted for additional available data. Finally, the \nbibliographies of SLRs and meta-analyses identified through \ndatabase searches and selected key RCTs were reviewed to \nensure literature saturation. Details of the search strategy are \npresented in Appendix 1; the full SLR protocol has been reg-\nistered with PROSPERO.17\nStudy Selection\nTitle/abstract and full-text screenings were conducted sequen-\ntially and in parallel by 2 independent researchers to iden-\ntify studies that met the SLR eligibility criteria, which are \ndescribed in detail in Appendix 2. From the SLR, to meet the \nstudy objectives and minimize between-study heterogeneity, a \nnarrower set of inclusion criteria was imposed for the NMA \nwhich is described in Table 1.\nOutcomes\nEfficacy outcomes based on the Full Mayo score (FMS) were \nassessed as possible. The FMS consists of 4 items, each with \na subscore that ranges from 0 to 3 whole points: stool fre-\nquency subscore (SFS), rectal bleeding subscore (RBS), en-\ndoscopic Mayo subscore (EMS), and physician\u2019s global \nassessment (PGA).18 The efficacy outcomes analyzed by prior \nbiologic exposure were clinical response (decrease from base-\nline in FMS \u22653 points and \u226530%, accompanied by a decrease \nin RBS of \u22651 or an absolute RBS \u22641), clinical remission (FMS \n\u22642 with no subscore >1), and endoscopic improvement (EMS \n\u22641). Deviations from these definitions are noted in Appendix \n5. The safety outcomes analyzed in the overall populations \nwere all adverse events (AEs), discontinuation due to AEs, \nserious AEs, and serious infections, as reported in the RCT \npublications. Only outcomes evaluated during randomized, \ndouble-blinded phases were considered. Each binary outcome \nwas assessed after induction and maintenance, for a total \nof 20 NMAs conducted (ie, induction and maintenance of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/crohnscolitis360/article/5/2/otad009/7066911 by National University of Singapore user on 23 May 2023", "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "otad009.pdf"}}, {"text": "and M.F.), and discrepancies wereWhat You Need to Know\nBackground\nA systematic review and network meta-analysis is\nneeded to compare ef \ufb01cacy and safety of \ufb01rst-line\n(biologic-na\u00efve) and second-line (prior exposure totumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents fortreatment of moderate to severely active ulcerativecolitis.\nFindings\nIn\ufb02iximab was ranked highest in biologic-na\u00efve pa-\ntients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked\nhighest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopicimprovement.

choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.\n\n1. Infliximab:\n   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which is involved in the inflammation process in ulcerative colitis. It has been ranked highest for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in biologic-naive patients.\n   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may not be convenient for a patient who values limited time spent in the hospital. There may also be risks associated with its use, including the potential for serious infections.\n\n2. Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is another effective treatment for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It targets \u03b1 or \u03b2 integrins, which are involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has been recommended as a first-line therapy for patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis.\n   - Disadvantages: Like Infliximab, Vedolizumab is also administered intravenously, which may not be convenient for the patient. There may also be risks associated with its use, including the potential for serious infections.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific needs and preferences, and the potential risks and benefits of each treatment option should be thoroughly discussed with the patient.", "source_document": [{"text": "Volume 20 | July 2023 | 411\u2013412 | 412\nnature reviews gastroenterology & hepatology\nReferences\n1.

As a result of this\nvast landscape of treatment, positioning advanced therapies (according to clinical situation, ef \ufb01cacy and safety) is\nof paramount importance to providing personalized, appropriate IBD treatment.\nIn this publication the recent available literature is summarized for practical integration into clinical practice\nincluding comparative ef \ufb01cacy data, patient and disease demographics. We refer to recent publications and expert\nopinion in order to facilitate the decision making process of positioning biologicals IBD treatment.\n1. Introduction\nBiological therapies have revolutionized the management of in \ufb02am-\nmatory bowel diseases (IBD). Monoclonal antibodies against tumor ne-\ncrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) have been the cornerstone of IBD therapy\nsince the start of the century. In 1998, in \ufb02iximab was the \ufb01rst biological\nmedication approved for the use of Crohn's disease (CD), followed by\nadalimumab. Numerous studies have demonstrated their ef \ufb01cacy and\ncost effectiveness for the induction and maintenance of remission in CD\n(Townsend et al., 2020 ) and ulcerative colitis (UC) ( Colombel et al.,\n2007 ;Pantavou et al., 2019 ). Golimumab for UC ( Sandborn et al., 2014 )\nand Certolizumab pegol for CD ( Schreiber et al., 2010 ;Yamazaki et al.,\n2019 ) are other anti-TNF inhibitors that are currently available. After\nover 20 years of experience of prescribing anti-TNF agents, their safety\npro\ufb01le has been well described and dose optimization has been incor-\nporated into daily clinical practice although proactive monitoring re-\nmains a question of debate ( Argollo et al., 2020 ).\nMore recently, two additional biologicals, with different mechanisms\nof action, have complemented the IBD armamentarium. The \ufb01rst is\nvedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the homing receptor\n\u03b14\u03b27 integrin complex, blocking the interaction of the surface homing\nmolecules of activated immune cells with the endothelium to reduce\ndiapedesis. The second is ustekinumab, a humanized monoclonalantibody to the interleukin (IL) p40 subunit common to IL12/23. These\nnew agents have now proved their ef \ufb01cacy not only against placebo but\nalso in head-to-head trials against anti-TNF agents in speci \ufb01c indications\n(Sands et al., 2019 ,2021 ;Irving et al., 2021 ). Consequently, they possess\na comfortable market position compared to the historical anti-TNF\nagents, when not surpassing them for certain targeted groups of pa-\ntients. However, striking ef \ufb01cacy differences have not been shown to\nsupport their superiority and anti-TNF agents remain the most appro-\npriate medications in presence of most concomitant extraintestinal\nmanifestations or in \ufb01stulizing CD ( Juillerat et al., 2020 ;Papamichael\net al., 2021 ;Singh et al., 2021 ).", "metadata": {"page_label": 1, "file_name": "juillerat 2022.pdf"}}, {"text": "There is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD\npatients. During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to re-\nsponders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R,and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T\ncells. ( Bek et al., 2016 ;Schmitt et al., 2019 ). This phenomenon suggests\nthat ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor\nagents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD ( Eftychi et al., 2019 )\nwhen an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells ( Veny et al., 2010 ) may have\noccurred.\n3.2.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Personalized IBDcare is fast-evolving, and sophisticated prediction modelsincorporating multi-omic platforms are likely to be thefuture of IBD therapeutics.\nSupplementary Material\nNote: To access the supplementary material accompanying\nthis article, visit the online version of Gastroenterology at\nwww.gastrojournal.org , and at http://dxdoi.org/10.1053/\nj.gastro.2021.04.063 .\nReferences\n1.Torres J, Mehandru S, Colombel JF, et al.

Becausesafety is unlikely to be in \ufb02uenced signi \ufb01cantly by main-\ntenance therapy trial design, to inform comparativesafety, we conducted a single network meta-analysis ofall trials of maintenance therapy, regardless of different\ntrial design.

Keyword searches of \nthe annual proceedings of relevant scientific meetings (from \nlast 4 years) and clinical trial registers (no date limit) were \nalso conducted for additional available data. Finally, the \nbibliographies of SLRs and meta-analyses identified through \ndatabase searches and selected key RCTs were reviewed to \nensure literature saturation. Details of the search strategy are \npresented in Appendix 1; the full SLR protocol has been reg-\nistered with PROSPERO.17\nStudy Selection\nTitle/abstract and full-text screenings were conducted sequen-\ntially and in parallel by 2 independent researchers to iden-\ntify studies that met the SLR eligibility criteria, which are \ndescribed in detail in Appendix 2. From the SLR, to meet the \nstudy objectives and minimize between-study heterogeneity, a \nnarrower set of inclusion criteria was imposed for the NMA \nwhich is described in Table 1.\nOutcomes\nEfficacy outcomes based on the Full Mayo score (FMS) were \nassessed as possible. The FMS consists of 4 items, each with \na subscore that ranges from 0 to 3 whole points: stool fre-\nquency subscore (SFS), rectal bleeding subscore (RBS), en-\ndoscopic Mayo subscore (EMS), and physician\u2019s global \nassessment (PGA).18 The efficacy outcomes analyzed by prior \nbiologic exposure were clinical response (decrease from base-\nline in FMS \u22653 points and \u226530%, accompanied by a decrease \nin RBS of \u22651 or an absolute RBS \u22641), clinical remission (FMS \n\u22642 with no subscore >1), and endoscopic improvement (EMS \n\u22641). Deviations from these definitions are noted in Appendix \n5. The safety outcomes analyzed in the overall populations \nwere all adverse events (AEs), discontinuation due to AEs, \nserious AEs, and serious infections, as reported in the RCT \npublications. Only outcomes evaluated during randomized, \ndouble-blinded phases were considered. Each binary outcome \nwas assessed after induction and maintenance, for a total \nof 20 NMAs conducted (ie, induction and maintenance of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/crohnscolitis360/article/5/2/otad009/7066911 by National University of Singapore user on 23 May 2023", "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "otad009.pdf"}}, {"text": "Articleswww.thelancet.com/gastrohep   Vol 7   February 2022  169comparisons between all the included studies could only \nbe done for induction outcomes, as different trial designs (treat-straight-through vs \nrandomised res  ponders) for \nmaintenance studies could only be analysed in two different meta-analyses, in an approach similar to that used by Singh and colleagues.\n13 Fourth, the included \nstudies had important differences. Endoscopic outcomes were centrally read in more recent trials only; for most trials of biologics (except for the trials UNIFI\n31 and \nVARSITY29), these outcomes were defined locally. \nAdditionally, a more stringent definition of clinical remission, with a rectal bleeding sub-score of 0, was used in more recent clinical trials of small molecule drugs (ie, tofacitinib, ozanimod, filgotinib, and upadacitinib). Fifth, we analysed steroid-free remission\u2014a more robust and clinically meaningful outcome than clinical remission\u2014in maintenance trials only, as corticosteroid tapering was not allowed in induction trials. In addition, not all clinical trials reported on steroid-free remission, particularly the older trials. Finally, some preliminary reports, such as the trial of maintenance with subcutaneous vedolizumab, did not report relevant data for endoscopic improvement. \nAs with any indirect comparison, the results presented \nin this study should be interpreted with caution but could help clinicians to navigate the current scenario in which the number of therapeutic options for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis is steadily increasing. These findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating, until direct comparisons by means of head-to-head trials become available to fully elucidate the positioning of these therapies. Until then, these results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.\nContributors\nLP-B contributed to the study concept and design.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Studies included in these meta-\nanalyses were phase II or III randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to\nsevere ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6 \u201312,\nwith an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who wereeither treatment-na\u00efve ( \ufb01rst-line) or previously\nexposed to TNF aantagonists (second-line); (2) inter-\nvention: biologic therapy with in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab,\ngolimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,\nwith a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)comparator: another active intervention or placebo;\nand (4) outcome: induction of clinical remission (MayoClinic score of /C202 with no individual subscore of >1)\nand endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy sub-score of 0 or 1).\nBecause trials of maintenance therapy of biologic\nagents had different designs (treat straight-through\ndesign vs rerandomizing responders to induction ther-apy), we conducted separate pairwise and networkmeta-analyses for these different trial designs. Becausesafety is unlikely to be in \ufb02uenced signi \ufb01cantly by main-\ntenance therapy trial design, to inform comparativesafety, we conducted a single network meta-analysis ofall trials of maintenance therapy, regardless of different\ntrial design.

It has been shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. It also has a lower risk of serious infections compared to TNF antagonists.\n   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may not be the most appropriate biologic in the presence of extraintestinal manifestations such as primary sclerosing cholangitis. It may also have a slower onset of action compared to other biologics.\n\n2. Infliximab:\n   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. It has been associated with increasing rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality of life.\n   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is a TNF antagonist and may carry a higher risk of serious infections compared to Vedolizumab. It may also have potential for immunogenicity, leading to primary non-response or secondary loss of response. \n\nPlease note that the choice of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's specific clinical circumstances, and the potential benefits and risks of each treatment option should be discussed with the patient.", "source_document": [{"text": "Upadacitinib was significantly superior to all other interventions for the induction of clinical \nremission (infliximab [OR 2\u00b770, 95% CI 1\u00b718\u20136\u00b720], adalimumab [4\u00b764, 2\u00b747\u20138\u00b771], golimumab [3\u00b700, 1\u00b732\u20136\u00b782], vedolizumab [3\u00b756, 1\u00b784\u20136\u00b791], ustekinumab [2\u00b792, 1\u00b731\u20136\u00b751], etrolizumab [4\u00b791, 2\u00b759\u20139\u00b731], tofacitinib [2\u00b784, 1\u00b728\u20136\u00b731], filgotinib 100 mg [6\u00b715, 2\u00b798\u201312\u00b772], filgotinib 200 mg [4\u00b749, 2\u00b718\u20139\u00b724], and ozanimod (2\u00b770, 1\u00b718\u20136\u00b720), and ranked highest for the induction of clinical remission (SUCRA 0\u00b7996).

All rights reserved.\nIntroduction \nUlcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially \ndisabling condition that is clinically characterised by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.\n1 \nUlcerative colitis most commonly presents during the third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an impaired health-related quality of life and considerable economic burden.\n2,3\nNearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis \nfactor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, \nnamely vedolizumab and, more recently, usteki  numab. \nHowever, treatment with biologics has several \nlimit   ations, including limited efficacy, primary non-\nresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity,", "metadata": {"page_label": 1, "file_name": "1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf"}}, {"text": "Although vedolizumab is a gut-specific agent with a \nlesser degree of systemic immunosuppression potential, there is no \ndifference in the risk of serious infections between vedolizumab and \nTNF antagonists, potentially because of lower rates of achieving disease \ncontrol with vedolizumab. Other factors are involved in informed shared \ndecision-making \u2014 comorbid conditions, speed of onset of action and \na patient\u2019s values and preferences, such as the mode of administration, \ncost and access. In most jurisdictions, cost considerations upend these \ndiscussions, with a strong preference for using biosimilars for TNF antag -\nonists and conventional immunosuppressive agents like thiopurines \nand methotrexate in resource-limited settings (Fig.\u00a0 1).\nSimilar to Crohn\u2019s disease, there is a paucity of head-to-head clini -\ncal trials of advanced immunosuppressive therapies in patients with \nmoderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Integrating data from the VAR -\nSITY trial comparing vedolizumab versus adalimumab (Supplementary \nTable\u00a01) with data from phase II and III trials of approved therapies, \nnetwork meta-analyses suggest that upadacitinib, infliximab and ved -\nolizumab are probably the most efficacious therapies for induction \nof remission in patients who are biologic-naive, and are substantially \nmore effective than adalimumab5. In patients with prior exposure to \nTNF antagonists, upadacitinib is probably the most efficacious agent, \nmore effective than all other approved agents except ustekinumab. \nComparative safety studies suggest a lower risk of serious infections \nwith vedolizumab compared with TNF antagonists4. Based on the ORAL \nsurveillance study on the comparative safety of tofacitinib versus TNF \nantagonists in 4,362 older patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the US \nFood and Drug Administration issued an advisory limiting the use of \nall JAK inhibitors across all indications only to patients who have failed, \nor are intolerant to, TNF antagonists6 (Fig.\u00a0 1).\nThese indirect approaches, relying on network meta-analyses and \nobservational studies, have informed clinical guidelines to facilitate the \nmass personalization of therapy in routine clinical practice. However, \npersonalized medicine at an individual level remains unclear. For exam-\nple, which patient is at high risk of disease-related and treatment-related \ncomplications, which advanced immunosuppressive agent to choose, \nand in what order? Novel prognostic biomarkers and routine clinical fac -\ntors that predict disease course can help strike a balance between potent \nimmunosuppression and the risk of uncontrolled inflammation.

biological drugs for a 48-year-old woman with distal moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who prioritizes a rapid response to treatment would be Infliximab and Upadacitinib.\n\n1. Infliximab:\n- Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be superior to other therapies for moderate ulcerative colitis (SUCRA 0.93). It is particularly effective in the management of early moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and remains the first choice in cases of severe disease or when high-risk features are present. Infliximab is also associated with a rapid response to treatment, which aligns with the patient's priority.\n- Disadvantages: Infliximab, like other TNF inhibitors, can have side effects including risk of serious infections, lymphoma, and other malignancies. Patients may also develop antibodies to Infliximab, which can reduce its effectiveness over time.\n\n2. Upadacitinib:\n- Advantages: Upadacitinib has been shown to be significantly superior to all other interventions for the induction of clinical remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. It ranked highest for the induction of clinical remission (SUCRA 0.996), indicating its high efficacy.\n- Disadvantages: Upadacitinib was the worst performing agent in terms of adverse events in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. The safety profile of Upadacitinib needs to be considered, as it was associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared to other treatments.\n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential risks and benefits of the therapy. Regular follow-ups and monitoring are necessary to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of the treatment.\n\n[{\"drug_name\": \"Infliximab\", \"advantages\": \"Effective in the management of early moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, rapid response to treatment\", \"disadvantages\": \"Risk of serious infections, lymphoma, and other malignancies, potential development of antibodies reducing its effectiveness over time\"}, {\"drug_name\": \"Upadacitinib\", \"advantages\": \"High efficacy in inducing clinical remission in moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis\", \"disadvantages\": \"Higher rate of adverse events compared to other treatments\"}]", "source_document": [{"text": "may be reasonable to monitor such patients off therapy with\nclose follow-up and frequent symptom reassessment andmonitoring of FC and CRP. If patients have mild diseaseactivity, then an 8-week course of budesonide can be triedand patients can be monitored off therapy after stoppingsteroids. Immunomodulators (IMMs) may be a consider-ation in moderate disease nonresponsive to budesonide;\nhowever, long-term safety concerns limit this approach.\n60\nDue to lack of head-to-head trials, biologic positioning is\nreliant on indirect data, such as network meta-analyses andreal-world retrospective studies. In the former, the surfaceunder the cumulative ranking (SUCRA), a measure of therelative ranking of each treatment, is used for comparisons.SUCRA ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher number indicatinghigher ranking. For the management of early moderate tosevere CD, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) remainthe mainstay of treatment. In a network meta-analysis ofrandomized controlled trial data,\n87in\ufb02iximab (IFX) and\nadalimumab (ADA) were superior to other therapies for\nmoderate CD (SUCRA 0.93 and 0.75, respectively).

In moderate CD, especially when limited tothe colon and no high-risk features, vedolizumab (VDZ) andUST are ef \ufb01cacious \ufb01rst-line options with good safety\npro\ufb01les. In addition, although response to VDZ is lower\namong TNFi exposed, biologic-na\u00efve patients have higherrates of response. Results from ongoing head-to-head trialssuch as UST vs adalimumab ( ClinicalTrials.gov ID:\nNCT03464136) and risankizumab vs UST ( ClinicalTrials.\ngov ID: NCT04524611) will help clarify the positioning of\nbiologics.\nIn the case of severe CD, or when particularly high-risk\nfeatures, such as \ufb01stulizing or stricturing disease, or prox-\nimal involvement, a TNFi, particularly IFX, remains the \ufb01rst\nchoice.

Available data on treatment sequences in algorithms and guidelines\nData from the literature on strategies to position biological therapy is\nscarce. Guidance and consensus statements exist to help aid the decision\nmaking process. However there is a tendency to position all biologics on\nthe same level and to consider them as interchangeable in the ECCO\nGuidelines ( Torres et al., 2020 ;Raine et al., 2021 ). These guidelines, used\nthe novel Grade methodology which prioritizes meta-analyses (or\nperform their own) to extract the necessary data to answer speci \ufb01c (so\ncall PICO) questions on IBD management (e.g. for anti-TNF agents in UC)\n(Raine et al., 2021 )).\nIn the most recent publication from the American Gastroenterology\nAssociation: \u201cTechnical Review, the Medical Management of Moderate toSevere Luminal and Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease \u201d, the question of\ncomparing the ef \ufb01cacy between all available biologics is addressed\n(Singh et al., 2021 ). The conclusion was that in biologic-na\u00efve patients\nwith moderate to severely active CD, in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab, and\nustekinumab are the most effective compared to vedolizumab and cer-\ntolizumab pegol. In \ufb02iximab was considered the strongest for induction.\nHowever, in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to in \ufb02iximab),\nthe bene \ufb01t of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain. A\nsummary of the ef \ufb01cacies of the various biological agents, according to\nthe line of treatment and previous treatment failures and patients'\nphenotype, is provided in Table 2 . The \ufb01nal word about the ef \ufb01cacy of\nbiologics in IBD and the theoretical \u201ctherapeutic ceiling \u201dwhich cannot be\nbroken ( Alsoud et al., 2021 ) could potentially come from combining\nthese agents such as demonstrated by the recent VEGA study. This 3-arm\ntrial presented as one of the highlights of the recent ECCO congress 2022,\ncompared golimumab (GOL), guselkumab (GUS) and their combined use\nduring induction period of 12 weeks. This showed a signi \ufb01cant higher\nrate of clinical response (83% for combination therapy vs. 75% for GUS\n(p\u00bc0.215) and 61% for GOL (p\n\u00bc0.003)) and clinical remission (47%\nfor combination therapy vs. 24% for GUS (p \u00bc0.005) and 25% for GOL\n(p\u00bc0.007) based on modi \ufb01ed Mayo score) without added risks for safety\nin moderate to severely active UC patients na\u00efve to biologics ( Sands et al.,\n2022 ).\n3. Personalizing choice of biologic\n3.1. Prior biologic exposure\nIn current clinical practice we are confronted with numerous options\nof treatment sequencing. Personalizing IBD treatment depends on pre-\nvious drug exposure IBD (1st, 2nd, 3rd line of treatment), prior treatment\nresponse, comorbidities, safety pro \ufb01le, patient preferences and patient\nrisk for future IBD complications (disease severity). For example, primary\nnon response to an anti-TNF was found to be a predictor for diminished\ntreatment ef \ufb01cacy with an anti-integrin biologic ( Singh et al., 2018c ).\nFirst and second line agent treatment sequences and treatment response\nhave been presented in the previous chapter. However, data are even\nscarcer concerning third line of treatment after two anti-TNFs exposure.\nA retrospective small series of 67 patients with Crohn's disease treated\nwith 3rd line anti-TNF agent ( Allez et al., 2010 ) reported a lower\nresponse rate and the lack of late responders at 6 months. A recent\nmulticenter retrospective study reported the outcome of patients with\nlate CD who had failed treatment with one anti-TNF agent and either\nvedolizumab or ustekinumab.

Biologics with other targets were later approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, \nnamely vedolizumab and, more recently, usteki  numab. \nHowever, treatment with biologics has several \nlimit   ations, including limited efficacy, primary non-\nresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity,", "metadata": {"page_label": 1, "file_name": "1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf"}}, {"text": "Articleswww.thelancet.com/gastrohep   Vol 7   February 2022  161Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol \n2022; 7: 161\u201370\nPublished Online \nNovember 29, 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/ S2468-1253(21)00377-0\nSee Comment page 110\n*Contributed equallyInflammatory Bowel Disease \nUnit, Gastroenterology Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Centro de Educaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica e Investigaciones Cl\u00ednicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina (J S Lasa MD, P A Olivera MD); Gastroenterology Department, Hospital Brit\u00e1nico de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina (J S Lasa); Zane Cohen Centre for Digestive Diseases, Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada (P A Olivera); Division of Gastroenterology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada (P A Olivera); Gastroenterology and Endoscopy, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele and University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy (Prof S Danese MD); INSERM NGERE and Department of Hepatogastroenterology, Nancy University Hospital, Lorraine University, Vandoeuvre-l\u00e9s-Nancy, France (Prof L Peyrin-Biroulet MD) \nCorrespondence to: \nProf Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet, INSERM NGERE and Department of Hepatogastroenterology, Nancy University Hospital, Lorraine University, Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy F-54511, France peyrinbiroulet@gmail.comEfficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for \npatients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis \nJuan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet\nSummary\nBackground There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed \nto compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.\nMethods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane \nCentral Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and \nJuly 1, 2021. Major congresses\u2019 databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were included. Phase 2 RCTs were excluded because of their small sample sizes and inclusion of doses not further explored in phase 3 RCTs. Summary data from intention-to-treat analyses were extracted from included reports by JSL and PAO. The primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission. A network meta-analysis was done under the frequentist framework, obtaining pairwise odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) was used to rank the included agents for each outcome. Higher SUCRA scores correlate with better efficacy, whereas \nlower SUCRA scores correlate with better safety . Maintenance data on efficacy for treat-straight-through and \nrandomised responder trials are also presented. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021225329.\nFindings Our search yielded 5904 results, from which 29 studies (four being head-to-head RCTs) fulfilled our inclusion \ncriteria and were included. Of these, 23 studies assessed induction therapy with either a biologic or small molecule \ndrug, comprising 10  061 patients with ulcerative colitis. A risk of bias assessment showed a low risk of bias for most \nof the included studies.", "metadata": {"page_label": 1, "file_name": "1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf"}}, {"text": "Systematic\nreview with network meta-analysis: comparative assessment of tofacitinib and\nbiological therapies for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.

Guidance and consensus statements exist to help aid the decision\nmaking process. However there is a tendency to position all biologics on\nthe same level and to consider them as interchangeable in the ECCO\nGuidelines ( Torres et al., 2020 ;Raine et al., 2021 ). These guidelines, used\nthe novel Grade methodology which prioritizes meta-analyses (or\nperform their own) to extract the necessary data to answer speci \ufb01c (so\ncall PICO) questions on IBD management (e.g. for anti-TNF agents in UC)\n(Raine et al., 2021 )).\nIn the most recent publication from the American Gastroenterology\nAssociation: \u201cTechnical Review, the Medical Management of Moderate toSevere Luminal and Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease \u201d, the question of\ncomparing the ef \ufb01cacy between all available biologics is addressed\n(Singh et al., 2021 ). The conclusion was that in biologic-na\u00efve patients\nwith moderate to severely active CD, in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab, and\nustekinumab are the most effective compared to vedolizumab and cer-\ntolizumab pegol. In \ufb02iximab was considered the strongest for induction.\nHowever, in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to in \ufb02iximab),\nthe bene \ufb01t of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain. A\nsummary of the ef \ufb01cacies of the various biological agents, according to\nthe line of treatment and previous treatment failures and patients'\nphenotype, is provided in Table 2 . The \ufb01nal word about the ef \ufb01cacy of\nbiologics in IBD and the theoretical \u201ctherapeutic ceiling \u201dwhich cannot be\nbroken ( Alsoud et al., 2021 ) could potentially come from combining\nthese agents such as demonstrated by the recent VEGA study. This 3-arm\ntrial presented as one of the highlights of the recent ECCO congress 2022,\ncompared golimumab (GOL), guselkumab (GUS) and their combined use\nduring induction period of 12 weeks. This showed a signi \ufb01cant higher\nrate of clinical response (83% for combination therapy vs. 75% for GUS\n(p\u00bc0.215) and 61% for GOL (p\n\u00bc0.003)) and clinical remission (47%\nfor combination therapy vs. 24% for GUS (p \u00bc0.005) and 25% for GOL\n(p\u00bc0.007) based on modi \ufb01ed Mayo score) without added risks for safety\nin moderate to severely active UC patients na\u00efve to biologics ( Sands et al.,\n2022 ).\n3. Personalizing choice of biologic\n3.1. Prior biologic exposure\nIn current clinical practice we are confronted with numerous options\nof treatment sequencing. Personalizing IBD treatment depends on pre-\nvious drug exposure IBD (1st, 2nd, 3rd line of treatment), prior treatment\nresponse, comorbidities, safety pro \ufb01le, patient preferences and patient\nrisk for future IBD complications (disease severity). For example, primary\nnon response to an anti-TNF was found to be a predictor for diminished\ntreatment ef \ufb01cacy with an anti-integrin biologic ( Singh et al., 2018c ).\nFirst and second line agent treatment sequences and treatment response\nhave been presented in the previous chapter. However, data are even\nscarcer concerning third line of treatment after two anti-TNFs exposure.\nA retrospective small series of 67 patients with Crohn's disease treated\nwith 3rd line anti-TNF agent ( Allez et al., 2010 ) reported a lower\nresponse rate and the lack of late responders at 6 months. A recent\nmulticenter retrospective study reported the outcome of patients with\nlate CD who had failed treatment with one anti-TNF agent and either\nvedolizumab or ustekinumab. After 48 weeks on a third line of biologic\ntherapy the remission rate was 30.7% whereas the surgery rate was\n23.5% ( Kassouri et al., 2020 ).", "metadata": {"page_label": 3, "file_name": "juillerat

It also carries a risk of serious infections and other side effects like rash, nausea, and headache.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized, taking into account the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential risks.", "source_document": [{"text": "Till then our best options for pouchitis refractory to antibiotics were\nmostly anti-TNF agents but without very high level of evidence ( Kayal\nand Dubinsky, 2022 ): only one randomized controlled trial with adali-\nmumab ( Kj\u00e6r et al., 2019 ).\nRecent studies have linked the risk of antibody development against\nbiologic therapies, in particular anti-TNF agents, to the HLA pro \ufb01le of\npatients ( Sazonovs et al., 2020 ,2021 ). The authors associated the car-\nriage of the HLA-DQA1*05 allele, common to 40% of Europeans, with a\nhigher rate of immunogenicity to in \ufb02iximab and adalimumab. Although\ndetails of the evidence has been discussed, the same association was\nfound in the ABIRISK consortium in autoimmune diseases ( Hassler et al.,\n2020 ). Whether information on HLA allele carriage can be used pro-\nspectively to identify patients at risk of developing antibodies for a spe-\nci\ufb01c prospective intervention remains to be seen.Although the serological biomarkers ASCA and pANCA have long\nbeen used to help classify indeterminate colitis, their value in guiding\nmedical therapy is still limited. A recent study associated presence of\nASCA with extensive and severe disease phenotype and the need for an\nearly use of biologics for a better prognosis in a cohort of 273 CD pedi-\natric patients ( Chandrakumar et al., 2019 ), whereas a meta-analysis\nfound that pANCA positive IBD patients had a lower response rate to\nin\ufb02iximab therapy ( Nguyen et al., 2015 ).\nExtraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and\nrepresent an important cause of morbidity and disability ( Vavricka et al.,\n2011 ;Juillerat et al., 2020 ). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect\n30% of patients. They include non-in \ufb02ammatory joint pain as well as\nin\ufb02ammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as\nspondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, in \ufb02iximab and later\nthe other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD\npatient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials\nin both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established ef \ufb01cacies in most\nrheumatological indications ( Herfarth et al., 2002 ;Generini et al., 2004 ;\nLofberg et al., 2012 ;Louis et al., 2018 ).\nVedolizumab may not represent the most appropriate biologic in\npresence of articular manifestations of IBD. Indeed, by virtue of its\nbinding to \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, this antibody may not impede the entry of\nproin \ufb02ammatory cells in joints. In fact, it may even contribute to higher\nin\ufb02ux of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who\nobserved de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated\nIBD patients ( Diaz et al., 2020 ). An increased incidence of extra-\nintestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also\nbeen observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims\ndatabase ( Dubinsky et al., 2018 ). However, by improving disease activity\nthese drugs could still have an indirect impact on associated EIM, mostly\nperipheral arthritis, as suggested by the recent EMOTIVE retrospective\nanalysis ( Kopylov et al., 2021 ). Ustekinumab, however, has also limited\nrole in this indication, as this drug is also indicated in rheumatoid\narthritis ( Kerschbaumer et al., 2020 ). Dermatological extraintestinal\nmanifestations occur in up to 15% of IBD patients ( Vavricka et al., 2011 ).\nThe most common, erythema nodosum, depends on the underlying dis-\nease activity, whereas pyoderma gangrenosum may be associated with\nactive or inactive intestinal disease and requires rapid management, most\ncommonly with systemic medication. Treatment includes oral cortico-\nsteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and anti-TNF therapy (in \ufb02iximab or\nadalimumab), drugs that have good ef \ufb01cacy in several cases reports and\nsmall case series ( Juillerat et al., 2007 ).", "metadata": {"page_label": 5, "file_name": "juillerat 2022.pdf"}}, {"text": "Burr et al.  7 of 45 \nINTRODUCTION \n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] a nd the \ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of diseas e activity, \nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "Lancet\n387 (10014), 156 \u2013167.\nColombel, J.F., Sandborn, W.J., Rutgeerts, P., Enns, R., Hanauer, S.B., Panaccione, R.,\nSchreiber, S., Byczkowski, D., Li, J., Kent, J.D., Pollack, P.F., 2007.

Finally, the \nbibliographies of SLRs and meta-analyses identified through \ndatabase searches and selected key RCTs were reviewed to \nensure literature saturation. Details of the search strategy are \npresented in Appendix 1; the full SLR protocol has been reg-\nistered with PROSPERO.17\nStudy Selection\nTitle/abstract and full-text screenings were conducted sequen-\ntially and in parallel by 2 independent researchers to iden-\ntify studies that met the SLR eligibility criteria, which are \ndescribed in detail in Appendix 2. From the SLR, to meet the \nstudy objectives and minimize between-study heterogeneity, a \nnarrower set of inclusion criteria was imposed for the NMA \nwhich is described in Table 1.\nOutcomes\nEfficacy outcomes based on the Full Mayo score (FMS) were \nassessed as possible. The FMS consists of 4 items, each with \na subscore that ranges from 0 to 3 whole points: stool fre-\nquency subscore (SFS), rectal bleeding subscore (RBS), en-\ndoscopic Mayo subscore (EMS), and physician\u2019s global \nassessment (PGA).18 The efficacy outcomes analyzed by prior \nbiologic exposure were clinical response (decrease from base-\nline in FMS \u22653 points and \u226530%, accompanied by a decrease \nin RBS of \u22651 or an absolute RBS \u22641), clinical remission (FMS \n\u22642 with no subscore >1), and endoscopic improvement (EMS \n\u22641). Deviations from these definitions are noted in Appendix \n5. The safety outcomes analyzed in the overall populations \nwere all adverse events (AEs), discontinuation due to AEs, \nserious AEs, and serious infections, as reported in the RCT \npublications.

Endoscopic outcomes were centrally read in more recent trials only; for most trials of biologics (except for the trials UNIFI\n31 and \nVARSITY29), these outcomes were defined locally. \nAdditionally, a more stringent definition of clinical remission, with a rectal bleeding sub-score of 0, was used in more recent clinical trials of small molecule drugs (ie, tofacitinib, ozanimod, filgotinib, and upadacitinib). Fifth, we analysed steroid-free remission\u2014a more robust and clinically meaningful outcome than clinical remission\u2014in maintenance trials only, as corticosteroid tapering was not allowed in induction trials. In addition, not all clinical trials reported on steroid-free remission, particularly the older trials. Finally, some preliminary reports, such as the trial of maintenance with subcutaneous vedolizumab, did not report relevant data for endoscopic improvement. \nAs with any indirect comparison, the results presented \nin this study should be interpreted with caution but could help clinicians to navigate the current scenario in which the number of therapeutic options for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis is steadily increasing. These findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating, until direct comparisons by means of head-to-head trials become available to fully elucidate the positioning of these therapies. Until then, these results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.\nContributors\nLP-B contributed to the study concept and design.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Studies included in these meta-\nanalyses were phase II or III randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to\nsevere ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6 \u201312,\nwith an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who wereeither treatment-na\u00efve ( \ufb01rst-line) or previously\nexposed to TNF aantagonists (second-line); (2) inter-\nvention: biologic therapy with in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab,\ngolimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,\nwith a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)comparator: another active intervention or placebo;\nand (4) outcome: induction of clinical remission (MayoClinic score of /C202 with no individual subscore of >1)\nand endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy sub-score of 0 or 1).\nBecause trials of maintenance therapy of biologic\nagents had different designs (treat straight-through\ndesign vs rerandomizing responders to induction ther-apy), we conducted separate pairwise and networkmeta-analyses for these different trial designs. Becausesafety is unlikely to be in \ufb02uenced signi \ufb01cantly by main-\ntenance therapy trial design, to inform comparativesafety, we conducted a single network meta-analysis ofall trials of maintenance therapy, regardless of different\ntrial design.

It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also less likely to reactivate latent tuberculosis due to its gut-selective action.\n   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to show effects compared to other biologics. It also requires intravenous administration which might not be convenient for all patients.\n\n2. Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for some patients. It has a low risk of reactivating tuberculosis.\n   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may not be as effective as other biologics in some patients. It also requires initial intravenous induction.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and preferences, and should be made in consultation with the patient's healthcare provider.", "source_document": [{"text": "8 Vermeire S, Danese S, Zhou W, et al.

In the absence of head-to-head comparisons,prior network meta-analyses have attempted toaddress this gap, but have been limited by the number\nof studies, especially regarding comparative ef \ufb01cacy of\nagents in patients with prior exposure to TNF aantag-\nonists.\n4,5With the recent labeling and dosing change\nfor tofacitinib in light of safety considerations, recentpublication of a head-to-head trial comparing vedolizu-mab vs adalimumab in patients with moderate \u2013severe\nulcerative colitis, and recent regulatory approval ofustekinumab for these patients, the results of these an-\nalyses warrant updating.\n6,7\nHence, we updated our prior systematic review with\nnetwork meta-analyses, comparing the relative ef \ufb01cacy\nand safety of in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedo-\nlizumab, tofacitinib, and ustekinumab as \ufb01rst- and\nsecond-line agents in patients with moderate \u2013severe\nulcerative colitis. We used the Grading of Recommen-dations Assessment, Development and Evaluation\n(GRADE) approach for network meta-analysis to\nappraise the con \ufb01dence in estimates.\n8\nMethods\nThis systematic review was performed using an a\npriori established protocol, and is reported according\nto the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-views and Meta-Analyses extension statement for sys-tematic reviews incorporating network meta-analysesfor health care interventions.\n9We followed good\nresearch practices outlined in the International Societyfor Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research reporton interpreting indirect treatment comparisons and\nnetwork meta-analysis for health care decision\nmaking.\n10\nStudy Selection\nWe conducted 2 separate pairwise and network\nmeta-analyses of induction therapy to estimate thecomparative ef \ufb01cacy of different agents in biologic-\nna\u00efve patients and in patients with prior exposure toTNFaantagonists for management of moderate \u2013severe\nulcerative colitis. Studies included in these meta-\nanalyses were phase II or III randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to\nsevere ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6 \u201312,\nwith an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who wereeither treatment-na\u00efve ( \ufb01rst-line) or previously\nexposed to TNF aantagonists (second-line); (2) inter-\nvention: biologic therapy with in \ufb02iximab, adalimumab,\ngolimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,\nwith a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)comparator: another active intervention or placebo;\nand (4) outcome: induction of clinical remission (MayoClinic score of /C202 with no individual subscore of >1)\nand endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy sub-score of 0 or 1).\nBecause trials of maintenance therapy of biologic\nagents had different designs (treat straight-through\ndesign vs rerandomizing responders to induction ther-apy), we conducted separate pairwise and networkmeta-analyses for these different trial designs. Becausesafety is unlikely to be in \ufb02uenced signi \ufb01cantly by main-\ntenance therapy trial design, to inform comparativesafety, we conducted a single network meta-analysis ofall trials of maintenance therapy, regardless of different\ntrial design.

Keyword searches of \nthe annual proceedings of relevant scientific meetings (from \nlast 4 years) and clinical trial registers (no date limit) were \nalso conducted for additional available data. Finally, the \nbibliographies of SLRs and meta-analyses identified through \ndatabase searches and selected key RCTs were reviewed to \nensure literature saturation. Details of the search strategy are \npresented in Appendix 1; the full SLR protocol has been reg-\nistered with PROSPERO.17\nStudy Selection\nTitle/abstract and full-text screenings were conducted sequen-\ntially and in parallel by 2 independent researchers to iden-\ntify studies that met the SLR eligibility criteria, which are \ndescribed in detail in Appendix 2. From the SLR, to meet the \nstudy objectives and minimize between-study heterogeneity, a \nnarrower set of inclusion criteria was imposed for the NMA \nwhich is described in Table 1.\nOutcomes\nEfficacy outcomes based on the Full Mayo score (FMS) were \nassessed as possible. The FMS consists of 4 items, each with \na subscore that ranges from 0 to 3 whole points: stool fre-\nquency subscore (SFS), rectal bleeding subscore (RBS), en-\ndoscopic Mayo subscore (EMS), and physician\u2019s global \nassessment (PGA).18 The efficacy outcomes analyzed by prior \nbiologic exposure were clinical response (decrease from base-\nline in FMS \u22653 points and \u226530%, accompanied by a decrease \nin RBS of \u22651 or an absolute RBS \u22641), clinical remission (FMS \n\u22642 with no subscore >1), and endoscopic improvement (EMS \n\u22641). Deviations from these definitions are noted in Appendix \n5. The safety outcomes analyzed in the overall populations \nwere all adverse events (AEs), discontinuation due to AEs, \nserious AEs, and serious infections, as reported in the RCT \npublications. Only outcomes evaluated during randomized, \ndouble-blinded phases were considered. Each binary outcome \nwas assessed after induction and maintenance, for a total \nof 20 NMAs conducted (ie, induction and maintenance of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/crohnscolitis360/article/5/2/otad009/7066911 by National University of Singapore user on 23 May 2023", "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "otad009.pdf"}}, {"text": "and M.F.), and discrepancies wereWhat You Need to Know\nBackground\nA systematic review and network meta-analysis is\nneeded to compare ef \ufb01cacy and safety of \ufb01rst-line\n(biologic-na\u00efve) and second-line (prior exposure totumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents fortreatment of moderate to severely active ulcerativecolitis.\nFindings\nIn\ufb02iximab was ranked highest in biologic-na\u00efve pa-\ntients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked\nhighest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopicimprovement.
