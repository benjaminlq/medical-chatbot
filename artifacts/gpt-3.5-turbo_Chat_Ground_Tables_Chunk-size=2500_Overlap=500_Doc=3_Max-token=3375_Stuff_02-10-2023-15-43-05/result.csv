REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile of a 40-year-old male with newly diagnosed moderate UC and articular extraintestinal manifestations, the top 2 choices of biological drugs are:

1. Ustekinumab:
Advantages:
- Ustekinumab has shown efficacy in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in biologic-naive patients with moderate-severe UC.
- It targets interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), which are involved in the inflammatory process of UC.
- Ustekinumab has a favorable safety profile, with no increased risk of serious adverse events compared to placebo.

Disadvantages:
- Ustekinumab is administered by subcutaneous injection, which may be inconvenient for some patients.
- Long-term safety data for ustekinumab in UC is limited.

2. Tofacitinib:
Advantages:
- Tofacitinib has shown efficacy in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in biologic-naive patients with moderate-severe UC.
- It is an oral medication, which may be more convenient for some patients.
- Tofacitinib has a rapid onset of action, with improvements seen as early as 2 weeks.

Disadvantages:
- Tofacitinib carries a black box warning for serious infections, malignancies, and thrombosis.
- Long-term safety data for tofacitinib in UC is limited.

It is important to note that the choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist, taking into consideration the patient's individual characteristics, preferences, and medical history.","Based on the patient profile of a 40-year-old male with newly diagnosed moderate UC and articular extraintestinal manifestations, the top 2 choices of biological drugs are:

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo."

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile of a 70-year-old female with newly diagnosed severe UC, the top 2 choices of biological drugs are:

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a well-established and effective treatment for moderate to severe UC. It targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and has shown efficacy in clinical trials. It can induce and maintain remission in patients with UC.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. There can be risks associated with its use, including infusion reactions, increased risk of infections, and potential for development of antibodies against the drug.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a newer biological therapy that targets α4β7 integrin, which is involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has shown efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It is administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may not work in all patients, and there can be risks associated with its use, including infusion reactions and increased risk of infections. It may take longer to achieve a response compared to other biological drugs.

Both infliximab and vedolizumab are viable options for the treatment of severe UC in this patient. The choice between the two would depend on factors such as patient preference, route of administration, and potential risks and benefits. It is important to discuss these options with the patient and consider their individual needs and preferences.","Based on the patient profile of a 70-year-old female with newly diagnosed severe UC, the top 2 choices of biological drugs are:

","Based on the patient profile provided, the patient is a 35-year-old male with known moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) who has previously been treated with infliximab but is experiencing worsening colitis on endoscopy despite compliance.

Given this information, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient profile are:

1. Upadacitinib:
   - Advantages: Upadacitinib has shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials for moderate to severe UC, ranking first in terms of clinical remission and clinical response in all patients, including those previously exposed to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α therapies. It has also shown endoscopic improvement in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies. Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses.
   - Disadvantages: The safety profile of upadacitinib is similar to other advanced therapies, with no significant differences in serious adverse events or serious infections compared to placebo. However, specific adverse events and long-term safety data may still need further evaluation.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a biological therapy that targets α4β7 integrin, which is involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has shown efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. Vedolizumab may be an option for patients who have failed or are intolerant to anti-TNF agents. It has also shown lower odds of discontinuation due to adverse events compared to placebo during maintenance.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may not work in all patients, and there may be risks associated with its use. Long-term safety data may still need further evaluation.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a new patient with newly diagnosed moderate UC and a background of congestive cardiac failure. There is no information provided regarding prior response to specific medications, prior failure to certain agents, age, pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis. Therefore, we cannot make a specific recommendation based on these criteria.

However, considering the patient's background of congestive cardiac failure, it is important to consider the cardiovascular safety profile of the available biological drugs for UC. Some biological drugs, such as vedolizumab, have a favorable cardiovascular safety profile compared to others, such as TNF inhibitors. This may be a relevant factor to consider when choosing a biological drug for this patient.

Based on the limited information provided, here are two potential choices of biological drugs for the patient:

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab has a favorable cardiovascular safety profile compared to TNF inhibitors, which may be beneficial for a patient with congestive cardiac failure. It specifically targets the gut immune system, reducing the risk of systemic immunosuppression.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may also take longer to achieve a response compared to other biological drugs.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is another option that does not target TNF-α and may have a favorable cardiovascular safety profile. It targets interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), which are involved in the inflammatory process in UC.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab is also administered intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may also have a slower onset of action compared to TNF inhibitors.

It is important to note that the final choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider who can consider the patient's complete medical history, preferences, and individual factors.","Based on the given patient profile of a 60-year-old female with newly diagnosed moderate UC and a background of congestive cardiac failure, we can consider the following choices of biological drugs:

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab has a favorable cardiovascular safety profile compared to TNF inhibitors, which may be beneficial for a patient with congestive cardiac failure. It specifically targets the gut immune system, reducing the risk of systemic immunosuppression. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in UC.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may also take longer to achieve a response compared to other biological drugs.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is another option that does not target TNF-α and may have a favorable cardiovascular safety profile.

   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may also have a slower onset of action compared to TNF inhibitors.

It is important to note that the final choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider who can consider the patient's complete medical history, preferences, and individual factors. Additionally, further information regarding the patient's prior response to medications, prior failure to certain agents, and other relevant factors would be necessary to make a more tailored recommendation.",,,"title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in

2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile provided, the patient is a newly diagnosed moderate UC patient with psoriasis. Since the patient is newly diagnosed, there is no information available regarding prior response to specific treatments or previous failures. Therefore, we cannot make a recommendation based on prior response or failure to specific drugs.

However, considering the patient's age and the presence of psoriasis, it may be beneficial to consider a biologic drug that has shown efficacy in both UC and psoriasis. Two potential choices for biologic drugs in this case are:

1. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is a biologic drug that targets interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), which are involved in the inflammatory process in both UC and psoriasis. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC and has also been approved for the treatment of psoriasis.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab is administered by subcutaneous injection, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It also carries the risk of potential side effects, including infections and allergic reactions.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a biologic drug that specifically targets the gut-homing integrin α4β7, which plays a role in the migration of inflammatory cells to the gut. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. While it is not specifically approved for the treatment of psoriasis, it has shown some efficacy in psoriasis as well.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is administered by intravenous infusion, which may be less convenient for some patients compared to subcutaneous injections. It also carries the risk of potential side effects, including infections and infusion reactions.

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile of a 25-year-old pregnant woman with severe distal ulcerative colitis, the treatment options may be limited due to the pregnancy. It is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of any medication prescribed during pregnancy.

1. Choice 1: 5-ASA (oral and/or topical)
Advantages:
- 5-ASA is considered safe for use during pregnancy and is often the first-line treatment for mild to moderate UC.
- It can help reduce inflammation in the colon and promote remission.
- It can be administered orally or topically, depending on the severity and location of the inflammation.

Disadvantages:
- 5-ASA may not be sufficient for severe cases of UC, especially if the inflammation extends beyond the distal colon.
- It may take time to achieve remission, and some patients may require additional medications or treatments.

2. Choice 2: Corticosteroids (systemic or topical)
Advantages:
- Corticosteroids can provide rapid relief of symptoms and help induce remission in severe cases of UC.
- They can be administered orally, intravenously, or topically, depending on the severity and location of the inflammation.
- In some cases, corticosteroids may be necessary to control the inflammation and prevent complications.

Disadvantages:
- Long-term use of corticosteroids is associated with potential side effects, including weight gain, mood changes, increased risk of infections, and bone loss.
- The use of systemic corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully considered due to potential risks to the fetus.

It is important to consult with a gastroenterologist and obstetrician to determine the most appropriate treatment option for the pregnant patient with severe distal ulcerative colitis. The decision should take into account the severity of the disease, the potential risks and benefits of the medications, and the overall health of the patient and fetus.","Based on the patient profile of a 25-year-old pregnant woman with severe distal ulcerative colitis, the treatment options may be limited due to the pregnancy.

2. Choice 2: Vedolizumab (VDZ)
Advantages:
- Vedolizumab is a newer biological therapy that specifically targets the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa.
- It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.
- It is administered intravenously, which may be more convenient for some patients.

Disadvantages:
- The safety of Vedolizumab during pregnancy is not well-established, and its use should be carefully considered.
- Limited data is available on the use of Vedolizumab in pregnant women, and potential risks to the fetus are not fully known.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Therefore, it is not possible to make a specific recommendation for biological drugs without additional information.","Based on the given patient profile of a 56-year-old man with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis, the following recommendations can be made for biological drugs:

1. Infliximab: Infliximab is a biological drug that targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). It has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. Pros of using Infliximab include its proven effectiveness in treating UC and its ability to induce and maintain remission. However, there may be risks associated with its use, such as infusion reactions and increased susceptibility to infections.

2. Vedolizumab: Vedolizumab is a newer biological therapy that targets α or β integrins involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has been tested for the treatment of UC and has shown efficacy. Pros of using Vedolizumab include its targeted mechanism of action and its ability to specifically treat gut inflammation without suppressing the entire immune system. However, it may not work in all patients, and there may be risks associated with its use, such as infusion reactions and increased susceptibility to infections.

It is important to note that the final choice of biological drug should be based on a thorough evaluation of the patient's medical history, prior treatment response, and individual factors. Consultation with a gastroenterologist or rheumatologist experienced in the treatment of UC and ankylosing spondylitis is recommended to determine the most appropriate treatment option for this specific patient.",,,"title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile provided, the patient is a 38-year-old man with severe ulcerative colitis who has lost response to vedolizumab.

Given this information, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for this patient profile are:

1. Upadacitinib:
   - Advantages: Upadacitinib has shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It ranked first in terms of clinical remission and clinical response in all patients, including those who were previously exposed to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α therapies and those who were naive to these drugs. It may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies in achieving clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic response over 1 year.
   - Disadvantages: The safety profile of upadacitinib is similar to other advanced therapies, but specific adverse events and risks associated with its use may exist. Further information on the patient's medical history, comorbidities, and potential contraindications is needed to assess the suitability of upadacitinib for this patient.

2. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a well-established biological therapy for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials. It ranked first in terms of endoscopic improvement in the study mentioned in the context. Infliximab can be administered intravenously, which may be convenient for some patients.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab, like other TNF-α inhibitors, may be associated with potential risks and adverse events, including infusion reactions, increased risk of infections, and development of antibodies to the drug. The patient's prior response to infliximab and any potential contraindications should be considered before initiating or reinitiating treatment with this drug.

It is important to note that the final choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider who has access to the patient's complete medical history and can assess the individual's specific needs and circumstances.","Based on the patient profile provided, the patient is a 38-year-old man with severe ulcerative colitis who has lost response to vedolizumab.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

However, the specific information regarding the patient's prior treatment history is not provided in the context. Therefore, it is not possible to make a specific recommendation based on the given information. Without information on the patient's prior treatment history, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate biological drug options. However, considering the severity of the disease and the patient's history of lymphoma, it may be prudent to consider a biological drug with a favorable safety profile. One potential option could be ustekinumab, which targets interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 and has shown efficacy in moderate to severe UC. Pros of ustekinumab include its different mechanism of action compared to anti-TNF agents and vedolizumab, which may be beneficial for patients who have failed these treatments. Additionally, ustekinumab has a favorable safety profile and is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for patients. However, it is important to note that the specific efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in patients with a history of lymphoma may need to be further evaluated. Another potential option could be tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. Tofacitinib has shown efficacy in moderate to severe UC and is administered orally, which may be convenient for patients. However, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with JAK inhibitors, including the risk of serious infections and malignancies. Additionally, the specific safety of tofacitinib in patients with a history of lymphoma may need to be further evaluated. Overall, the choice of biological drug should be individualized based on the patient's specific characteristics, treatment history, and potential risks and benefits.",,,"title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

Additionally, the patient's prior response to different treatments and any other relevant factors should be taken into account.

Given the lack of information regarding the patient's prior response to treatments and other relevant factors, it is not possible to provide a specific recommendation for biological drugs. However, it is important to consult with a gastroenterologist and a neurologist to assess the potential risks and benefits of different treatment options.

Potential choices of biological drugs for ulcerative colitis in patients with multiple sclerosis may include vedolizumab and ustekinumab. However, the decision to use these drugs should be made in consultation with the patient's healthcare team, taking into consideration the patient's specific medical history, disease severity, and treatment goals.

Pros and cons of vedolizumab:
- Pros: Vedolizumab specifically targets the gut, which may be beneficial for patients with multiple sclerosis who are at risk of central nervous system side effects from systemic treatments. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
- Cons: Vedolizumab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may also have potential side effects, including infusion reactions and increased risk of infections.

Pros and cons of ustekinumab:
- Pros: Ustekinumab targets interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, which are involved in the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
- Cons: Ustekinumab is administered subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may also have potential side effects, including increased risk of infections and allergic reactions.

  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the given patient profile, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis are:

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages:
     - Vedolizumab specifically targets α4β7 integrin, which is involved in the migration of immune cells to the inflamed intestinal mucosa. This targeted mechanism of action reduces the risk of systemic immunosuppression.
     - It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
     - Vedolizumab has a favorable safety profile with a low risk of serious adverse events.
     - It can be administered intravenously, which may be more convenient for some patients.
   - Disadvantages:
     - Vedolizumab may take longer to achieve a response compared to other biological drugs.
     - It requires regular intravenous infusions, which may be inconvenient for some patients.
     - There is a risk of infusion reactions, although they are generally mild and can be managed with premedication.

2. Tofacitinib:
   - Advantages:
     - Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that targets the intracellular signaling pathways involved in inflammation.
     - It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
     - Tofacitinib has a convenient oral dosing regimen.
     - It has a rapid onset of action, with some patients experiencing symptom improvement within a few weeks.
   - Disadvantages:
     - Tofacitinib carries a risk of serious infections, including opportunistic infections.
     - There is a potential increased risk of thromboembolic events, especially at higher doses.
     - Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function, and lipid levels is required during treatment.
     - Tofacitinib is contraindicated in patients with a history of malignancy.

It is important to note that the final choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist, taking into consideration the patient's specific medical history, preferences, and individual response to treatment.","Based on the given patient profile, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis are:

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with moderate to severe distal ulcerative colitis who had a successful induction with vedolizumab. The query is about the appropriate maintenance therapy for this patient.

Based on the information provided, the patient has responded well to vedolizumab during the induction phase. Therefore, vedolizumab can be considered as a suitable maintenance therapy for this patient. Vedolizumab is an advanced therapy that specifically targets the gut-homing lymphocytes, reducing inflammation in the gut. It has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Another option for maintenance therapy in this patient could be adalimumab. Adalimumab is another advanced therapy that targets tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein involved in the inflammatory process. It has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Both vedolizumab and adalimumab have their advantages and disadvantages:

Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: It specifically targets gut inflammation, minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. It has a favorable safety profile and can be used in patients who have failed or are intolerant to other medications.
- Disadvantages: It is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may take several weeks to achieve a response, and some patients may not respond at all.

Adalimumab:
- Advantages: It is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for patients. It has a rapid onset of action and can be self-administered at home. It has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.
- Disadvantages: It carries a risk of systemic side effects, including increased susceptibility to infections. It may not be suitable for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other TNF inhibitors.

In summary, the top two choices for maintenance therapy in this patient with a successful induction with vedolizumab would be vedolizumab itself or adalimumab. The choice between the two would depend on factors such as patient preference, convenience, and the presence of any contraindications or previous adverse reactions. It is important to discuss these options with the patient and consider their individual needs and preferences.","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with moderate to severe distal ulcerative colitis who had a successful induction with vedolizumab. The query is about the appropriate maintenance therapy for this patient.

Given that the patient had a successful induction with vedolizumab, it would be reasonable to continue with vedolizumab as the maintenance therapy. Vedolizumab is an advanced therapy that specifically targets the gut-homing lymphocytes, reducing inflammation in the gut. It has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Another option for maintenance therapy in this patient could be adalimumab. Adalimumab is another advanced therapy that targets tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein involved in the inflammatory process. It has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Both vedolizumab and adalimumab have their advantages and disadvantages:

Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: It specifically targets gut inflammation, minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. It has a favorable safety profile and can be used in patients who have failed or are intolerant to other medications.
- Disadvantages: It is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may take several weeks to achieve a response, and some patients may not respond at all.

Adalimumab:
- Advantages: It is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for patients. It has a rapid onset of action and can be self-administered at home. It has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.
- Disadvantages: It carries a risk of systemic side effects, including increased susceptibility to infections. It may not be suitable for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other TNF inhibitors.

In summary, the top two choices for maintenance therapy in this patient with a successful induction with vedolizumab would be vedolizumab itself or adalimumab. The choice between the two would depend on factors such as patient preference, convenience, and the presence of any contraindications or previous adverse reactions. It is important to discuss these options with the patient and consider their individual needs and preferences.",,,"title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Background:  Given rapid innovation in advanced therapies for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), we investigated their com-
parative efficacy and safety during induction and maintenance through network meta-analysis.
Methods:  Using Bayesian methods, endpoints of clinical remission and clinical response per Full Mayo score, and endoscopic improvement
were assessed in bio-naive and -exposed populations. Safety was assessed in overall populations by all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs,
discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by"

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a 24-year-old man with moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis who previously achieved clinical remission with infliximab but developed loss of response due to antibody formation.

Based on the context provided, the study highlights the efficacy of different biological therapies for ulcerative colitis. However, the specific details about the patient's prior response to other anti-TNF agents, Vedolizumab, age, pregnancy status, extraintestinal manifestations, and pouchitis are not mentioned. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive recommendation based on this information alone.

However, considering the patient's loss of response to infliximab due to antibody formation, it may be reasonable to consider the following options:

1. Vedolizumab: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist that has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It works by specifically targeting the gut immune system, reducing inflammation without suppressing the entire immune system. As the patient has already failed infliximab, switching to a different mechanism of action like Vedolizumab may be beneficial. However, the patient's prior response to Vedolizumab is not mentioned, so its effectiveness in this specific case is uncertain.

2. Upadacitinib: Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that has shown promising results in phase III clinical trials for ulcerative colitis. It ranked first in terms of clinical remission and clinical response in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies and in anti-TNF-α naive patients. Since the patient has already failed infliximab, which is an anti-TNF agent, Upadacitinib may be a potential option. However, the patient's age and other factors that may influence the use of JAK inhibitors are not mentioned, so its suitability for this patient cannot be determined.

It is important to note that the final choice of biological drugs should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider who has access to the patient's complete medical history and can consider other factors such as safety profile, contraindications, and individual patient preferences.","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a 24-year-old man with moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis who previously achieved clinical remission with infliximab but developed loss of response due to antibody formation.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile provided, the patient is a 44-year-old woman with moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Given this information, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the patient are:

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-α inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It can induce and maintain remission in patients with UC. It is administered intravenously, usually every 8 weeks, which may be convenient for some patients.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab carries the risk of serious adverse effects, including increased susceptibility to infections, infusion reactions, and development of antibodies against the drug. It may also require pre-medication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to minimize infusion reactions.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a selective α4β7 integrin antagonist that specifically targets immune cells involved in the inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. It is administered intravenously every 8 weeks, which may be convenient for some patients.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may increase the risk of infections, including opportunistic infections. It may also cause infusion reactions, although they are generally mild. It is contraindicated in patients with active infections.

It is important to note that the final choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or rheumatologist, taking into consideration the patient's specific medical history, preferences, and response to previous treatments.","Based on the patient profile provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the patient are:

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-α inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It can induce and maintain remission in patients with UC. It is administered intravenously, usually every 8 weeks, which may be convenient for some patients. Infliximab has also been shown to be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, which is a comorbidity in this patient.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab carries the risk of serious adverse effects, including increased susceptibility to infections, infusion reactions, and development of antibodies against the drug. It may also require pre-medication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to minimize infusion reactions. Additionally, the patient's prior response to Infliximab should be considered before initiating treatment.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a selective α4β7 integrin antagonist that specifically targets immune cells involved in the inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. It is administered intravenously every 8 weeks, which may be convenient for some patients. Vedolizumab does not carry the same risk of developing antibodies as Infliximab.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may increase the risk of infections, including opportunistic infections. It may also cause infusion reactions, although they are generally mild. It is contraindicated in patients with active infections. The patient's prior response to Vedolizumab should be considered before initiating treatment.

It is important to note that the final choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or rheumatologist, taking into consideration the patient's specific medical history, preferences, and response to previous treatments.",,,"title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis are:

1. Vedolizumab:
- Advantages:
  - Vedolizumab specifically targets α4β7 integrin, which is involved in the migration of immune cells to the inflamed intestinal mucosa. This targeted mechanism of action reduces the risk of systemic immunosuppression compared to other biologic drugs.
  - It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC.
  - Vedolizumab is administered intravenously every 8 weeks, which may be more convenient for patients who prefer less frequent hospital visits.
  - It has a favorable safety profile with a low risk of serious adverse events.

- Disadvantages:
  - Vedolizumab may take longer to achieve a response compared to other biologic drugs.
  - It is not recommended for patients with a history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or active systemic infections.
  - Some patients may develop infusion reactions, although these are generally mild and can be managed.

2. Tofacitinib:
- Advantages:
  - Tofacitinib is an oral medication, which may be more convenient for patients who prefer not to receive intravenous or subcutaneous injections.
  - It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC.
  - Tofacitinib has a rapid onset of action, with some patients experiencing symptom improvement within a few weeks.
  - It can be used as both induction and maintenance therapy.

- Disadvantages:
  - Tofacitinib carries a higher risk of serious infections compared to other biologic drugs.
  - Long-term safety data for tofacitinib in UC is limited.
  - It may increase the risk of cardiovascular events, malignancies, and other serious adverse events.
  - Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function, and lipid levels is required.

It is important to note that the choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist, taking into consideration the patient's individual characteristics, preferences, and medical history.","Based on the patient profile provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis are:

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile provided, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with severe ulcerative colitis who has lost response to anti-TNF agents (such as infliximab), vedolizumab, and ustekinumab.

Given the patient's history of treatment failure with multiple biologic agents, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient would be:

1. Upadacitinib: Upadacitinib is a small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that has shown efficacy in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is recommended as a second-line therapy for patients who have failed anti-TNF agents. Upadacitinib has been shown to induce clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with prior failure of infliximab. The advantage of upadacitinib is its different mechanism of action compared to biologic agents, which may provide a new treatment option for patients who have not responded to previous biologic therapies. However, it is important to note that JAK inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and other adverse events.

2. Infliximab monotherapy: Although the patient has previously failed infliximab, it may still be considered as a treatment option as monotherapy. In some cases, patients who have lost response to infliximab in combination with immunomodulators may still respond to infliximab when used as monotherapy. Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist and has been shown to be effective in inducing remission and improving endoscopic outcomes in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The advantage of infliximab monotherapy is that it is a well-established treatment option with a known efficacy profile. However, it is important to consider the patient's previous lack of response to infliximab in combination with immunomodulators, which may indicate a reduced likelihood of response to infliximab monotherapy.

It is important to note that the choice of treatment should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider who can assess the patient's specific clinical situation and consider other factors such as the patient's overall health, comorbidities, and preferences.","Based on the patient profile provided, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with severe ulcerative colitis who has lost response to anti-TNF agents (such as infliximab), vedolizumab, and ustekinumab.

Given the patient's history of treatment failure with multiple biologic agents, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient would be:

1. Upadacitinib: Upadacitinib is a small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that has shown efficacy in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is recommended as a second-line therapy for patients who have failed anti-TNF agents. Upadacitinib has been shown to induce clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with prior failure of infliximab. The advantage of upadacitinib is its different mechanism of action compared to biologic agents, which may provide a new treatment option for patients who have not responded to previous biologic therapies. However, it is important to note that JAK inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and other adverse events.

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo."

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile provided, the patient is a 36-year-old man with moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis and spondylarthristis.

Given this information, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for this patient profile are:

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-α inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It can induce and maintain remission in patients with UC, including those who have not responded to other treatments. It can also improve symptoms of spondylarthristis.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It can also have potential risks and side effects, including infusion reactions, increased risk of infections, and development of antibodies to the drug.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a selective α4β7 integrin antagonist that specifically targets immune cells involved in the inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. It has shown efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC and can induce and maintain remission. It may also improve symptoms of spondylarthristis.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It can also have potential risks and side effects, including increased risk of infections and infusion reactions.

It is important to note that the choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider who can consider the patient's specific medical history, preferences, and individual response to previous treatments.","Based on the patient profile provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for this patient profile are:

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo."

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis are:

1. Infliximab:
- Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-α inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It can induce and maintain remission in patients with UC. It is administered intravenously, typically as an induction dose followed by maintenance doses. Infliximab has a well-established safety profile and has been used for many years in the treatment of UC.
- Disadvantages: Infliximab requires intravenous administration, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It is associated with potential risks, including infusion reactions, infections, and the development of antibodies that can reduce its effectiveness over time. Regular monitoring is required to assess response and detect any adverse effects.

2. Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: Vedolizumab is a selective α4β7 integrin antagonist that specifically targets immune cells involved in the inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. Vedolizumab is administered intravenously and has a favorable safety profile. It does not suppress the entire immune system, which may be advantageous for some patients.
- Disadvantages: Vedolizumab requires intravenous administration, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may take longer to achieve a response compared to other biologic agents. Regular monitoring is required to assess response and detect any adverse effects.

It is important to note that the choice of biological drug should be individualized based on the patient's specific characteristics, preferences, and medical history. The decision should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider experienced in the management of ulcerative colitis.","Based on the patient profile provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis are:

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a 42-year-old woman with severe ulcerative colitis and rare fistulating disease.

Given the severity of the disease and the presence of fistulas, the patient may be considered a candidate for biological therapy. However, the specific choice of biological drug depends on various factors.

Since the patient has severe ulcerative colitis, it is important to consider the patient's prior response to different treatments and any previous failures. Unfortunately, the given information does not provide any details about the patient's prior response to treatments or failures to specific drugs. Therefore, we cannot make a specific recommendation based on this information.

Additionally, the patient's age, pregnancy status, extraintestinal manifestations, and pouchitis status are not mentioned in the given information, which further limits our ability to make a specific recommendation.

In summary, based on the limited information provided, we cannot make a specific recommendation for the choice of biological drug for this patient. Further evaluation and consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider specializing in inflammatory bowel disease would be necessary to determine the most appropriate treatment options for this patient.","Based on the given patient profile of a 42-year-old woman with severe ulcerative colitis and rare fistulating disease, the choice of biological drugs can be considered. However, the specific recommendation depends on various factors that are not provided in the given information, such as the patient's prior response to treatments, failures to specific drugs, age, pregnancy status, extraintestinal manifestations, and pouchitis status.

Without this information, it is not possible to make a specific recommendation for the choice of biological drug. However, based on general considerations for severe ulcerative colitis, two potential choices of biological drugs could be considered:

1. Infliximab: Infliximab is a drug that targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). It has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. Pros of using Infliximab include its proven effectiveness in treating UC and its ability to induce and maintain remission. However, it is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. Additionally, there may be risks associated with its use, such as infusion reactions and increased susceptibility to infections.

2. Vedolizumab: Vedolizumab is a newer biological therapy that targets α or β integrins involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has been tested for the treatment of UC and has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission. Pros of using Vedolizumab include its targeted mechanism of action and its potential for fewer systemic side effects compared to drugs like Infliximab. However, it is also administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

It is important to note that these recommendations are based on general considerations and do not take into account the specific patient's characteristics and treatment history.

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis are:

1. Vedolizumab:
Advantages:
- Vedolizumab specifically targets α4β7 integrin, which is involved in the migration of immune cells to the inflamed intestinal mucosa.
- It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
- Vedolizumab has a favorable safety profile with a low risk of serious adverse events.
- It can be administered intravenously, which may be convenient for patients.

Disadvantages:
- Vedolizumab may take several weeks to months to achieve a response, so it may not provide immediate relief of symptoms.
- It requires regular intravenous infusions, which may be inconvenient for some patients.
- There is a risk of infusion reactions, although they are generally mild and can be managed with premedication.

2. Tofacitinib:
Advantages:
- Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that targets the intracellular signaling pathways involved in inflammation.
- It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
- Tofacitinib has a rapid onset of action and can provide symptomatic relief relatively quickly.
- It can be taken orally, which may be more convenient for patients.

Disadvantages:
- Tofacitinib carries a risk of serious infections, including opportunistic infections, and malignancies.
- It may cause an increase in lipid levels and blood pressure, requiring monitoring and management.
- There is a risk of gastrointestinal perforation, although it is rare.

It is important to note that the choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider, taking into consideration the patient's specific medical history, comorbidities, and preferences.","Based on the patient profile provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis are:

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Given the severity of the UC and the presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis with decompensated cirrhosis, the treatment options may be limited and require careful consideration.

1. Vedolizumab (VDZ):
- Advantages: VDZ is a selective integrin antagonist that specifically targets the gut, reducing inflammation in the intestines. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. VDZ has a favorable safety profile and is generally well-tolerated.
- Disadvantages: VDZ may take several weeks to months to achieve a response, so it may not provide immediate relief for the patient. Additionally, VDZ is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors (TNFi) with or without immunomodulators (IMM):
- Advantages: TNFi, such as infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab, have demonstrated efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. They can provide a rapid response and symptom relief. Adding an IMM, such as thiopurines, may enhance the effectiveness of TNFi.
- Disadvantages: TNFi may have potential side effects, including increased risk of infections, infusion reactions, and development of antibodies that can reduce their effectiveness over time. The use of TNFi in patients with decompensated cirrhosis requires careful monitoring due to the risk of hepatotoxicity.

It is important to note that the patient's primary sclerosing cholangitis with decompensated cirrhosis may impact the choice of treatment and require close collaboration with a hepatologist or gastroenterologist experienced in managing liver disease.

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small

1. Vedolizumab (VDZ): Vedolizumab is a newer biological therapy that targets α or β integrins involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has been tested and shown efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe UC.

Advantages of Vedolizumab:
- It specifically targets the gut immune system, reducing the risk of systemic side effects.
- It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.
- It can be used in patients who have failed or are intolerant to other treatments, including anti-TNF agents.

Disadvantages of Vedolizumab:
- It is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.
- It may take several weeks to months to achieve a response, so it may not provide a rapid response in all patients.

2. Ustekinumab (UST): Ustekinumab is another biological therapy that targets pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. It has been tested and shown efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe UC.

Advantages of Ustekinumab:
- It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.
- It can be used in patients who have failed or are intolerant to other treatments, including anti-TNF agents.
- It may provide a rapid response in some patients.

Disadvantages of Ustekinumab:
- It is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.
- It may have potential risks associated with its use, although specific risks were not mentioned in the given context.

Based on the patient's preference for a rapid response to treatment, Ustekinumab may be the preferred choice as it has the potential to provide a quicker response compared to Vedolizumab. However, the final decision should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, taking into consideration the patient's individual characteristics and preferences.","Based on the patient profile provided, the patient is a 48-year-old woman with distal moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who prioritizes a rapid response to treatment.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is an 18-year-old man with moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis and pyoderma gangrenosum.

Given the severity of the disease and the presence of extraintestinal manifestations (pyoderma gangrenosum), the patient may require treatment with biological drugs.

Since the patient is described as having moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, it is important to consider the patient's prior response to treatment and any prior failures to specific medications. However, this information is not provided in the given context, so we cannot make a specific recommendation based on prior treatment response.

Considering the patient's age, pregnancy is not a relevant factor in this case.

Given the presence of pyoderma gangrenosum, it may be beneficial to choose a biological drug that has shown efficacy in treating both ulcerative colitis and extraintestinal manifestations.

Based on the information provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for this patient profile are:

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a well-established biological drug that targets tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which is involved in the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Infliximab has also been reported to have efficacy in treating extraintestinal manifestations such as pyoderma gangrenosum.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It is also associated with potential side effects, including infusion reactions, increased risk of infections, and the development of antibodies that can reduce its effectiveness over time.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a selective integrin antagonist that specifically targets the gut-homing lymphocytes, which play a role in the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Vedolizumab has also demonstrated efficacy in treating extraintestinal manifestations such as pyoderma gangrenosum.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with moderate to severe distal ulcerative colitis and optic neuritis.

Since the patient has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, the treatment approach would typically involve the use of biological drugs. However, the presence of optic neuritis may impact the choice of treatment. Optic neuritis is an extraintestinal manifestation of ulcerative colitis and may require consideration of the potential effects of the chosen treatment on the optic nerve.

Given the limited information provided, it is difficult to determine the patient's prior treatment history, response to specific medications, or other relevant factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide specific recommendations for biological drugs at this time.

However, it is important for the patient to consult with a gastroenterologist or a healthcare professional experienced in the management of ulcerative colitis to discuss the treatment options and determine the most appropriate biological drugs based on the patient's individual circumstances, including the severity of the disease, prior treatment history, response to medications, and the potential impact on optic neuritis.","Based on the given patient profile of a 58-year-old woman with moderate to severe distal ulcerative colitis and optic neuritis, the following recommendations for biological drugs can be considered:

1. Vedolizumab: Vedolizumab is a biological therapy that specifically targets α4β7 integrin, which is involved in the migration of immune cells to the inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Pros:
- Targeted mechanism of action, reducing the risk of systemic immunosuppression.
- May be effective in patients who have failed or are intolerant to other biological therapies.
- Limited systemic side effects compared to other biological drugs.

Cons:
- Requires intravenous infusion, which may be inconvenient for some patients.
- Optic neuritis, as an extraintestinal manifestation, may require careful consideration of the potential impact of vedolizumab on the optic nerve.

2. Tofacitinib: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Pros:
- Oral administration, providing convenience for patients.
- May be effective in patients who have failed or are intolerant to other biological therapies.
- Can be used as both induction and maintenance therapy.

Cons:
- Increased risk of serious infections and malignancies.
- Optic neuritis, as an extraintestinal manifestation, may require careful consideration of the potential impact of tofacitinib on the optic nerve.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the patient profile provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis are:

1. Infliximab:
- Advantages: Infliximab is a drug that targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). It has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It can induce and maintain remission in patients with UC, reducing symptoms and inflammation in the colon. Infliximab is administered intravenously, typically every 8 weeks, which may be convenient for some patients.
- Disadvantages: Infliximab carries the risk of serious adverse effects, including infusion reactions, infections, and increased risk of certain types of cancer. It may also require pre-medication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to reduce the risk of infusion reactions. Additionally, some patients may develop antibodies to infliximab, leading to a loss of response over time.

2. Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: Vedolizumab is a newer biological therapy that targets α4β7 integrin, which is involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. Vedolizumab specifically targets the gut, which may reduce the risk of systemic side effects. It is administered intravenously every 8 weeks, which may be convenient for some patients.
- Disadvantages: Vedolizumab carries the risk of infusion reactions and infections. It may take longer to achieve a response compared to other biologic agents. Some patients may not respond to vedolizumab or may lose response over time. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening symptoms or lack of response during treatment.

It is important to note that the choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider who can consider the patient's specific medical history, preferences, and individual response to previous treatments.","Based on the patient profile provided, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis are:

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and
colorectal cancer.2,4,17 Other complications include anemia,
nutritional deﬁciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-
sive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inﬂamma-

eases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-
tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be
measured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.19
Limited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,
Symptoms, and Complications
The concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and
symptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a
population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

1. Vedolizumab:
- PROS: Vedolizumab is a selective integrin antagonist that specifically targets the gut, reducing the risk of systemic side effects. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.
- CONS: Vedolizumab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may also have a slower onset of action compared to other biologics.

2. Tofacitinib:
- PROS: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. It offers the convenience of oral administration.
- CONS: Tofacitinib may be associated with an increased risk of infections, including serious infections. It may also have potential side effects such as increased lipid levels and decreased blood counts.

It is important to note that the specific choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider, taking into consideration the patient's individual characteristics, preferences, and medical history.",,,"title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

REFINED ANSWER:
","Based on the given patient profile, we can analyze the treatment options for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the information provided does not specify whether the patient is a new patient or currently under maintenance treatment. Therefore, we cannot determine the prior response to specific medications or the patient's current treatment regimen. Additionally, there is no information provided regarding the patient's age, pregnancy status, extraintestinal manifestations, or history of pouchitis.

Without this crucial information, it is not possible to provide specific recommendations for biological drugs. The choice of treatment for UC depends on various factors, including disease severity, prior treatment response, patient preferences, and potential contraindications. It is important to consult with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider who can assess the patient's individual case and make appropriate treatment recommendations based on the available evidence and guidelines.","Based on the given patient profile of a 38-year-old woman with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and a history of pulmonary tuberculosis that was treated 2 years ago, we can consider the following options for biological drugs:

1. Vedolizumab: Vedolizumab is a selective integrin antagonist that specifically targets the gut-homing lymphocytes, thereby reducing inflammation in the intestines. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. The advantage of vedolizumab is its gut-selective mechanism of action, which may result in fewer systemic side effects compared to other biological drugs. However, it may take several weeks to months to achieve a response, and there is a risk of infusion reactions and infections.

2. Tofacitinib: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that inhibits the signaling pathways involved in inflammation. It has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe UC. Tofacitinib has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in UC, and it may be a suitable option for patients who prefer oral administration. However, it carries a risk of serious infections, including tuberculosis, and other potential side effects such as increased lipid levels and decreased blood counts.

It is important to note that the choice of biological drugs should be individualized based on the patient's specific characteristics, including disease severity, prior treatment response, and potential contraindications. The patient should consult with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider who can assess their case and make appropriate treatment recommendations based on the available evidence and guidelines.",,,"title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis
