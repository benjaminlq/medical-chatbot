Extraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and
represent an important cause of morbidity and disability (Vavricka et al.,
2011; Juillerat et al., 2020). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect
30% of patients. They include non-inﬂammatory joint pain as well as
inﬂammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as
spondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, inﬂiximab and later
the other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD
patient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials
in both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established efﬁcacies in most

Vedolizumab may not represent the most appropriate biologic in
presence of articular manifestations of IBD. Indeed, by virtue of its
binding to α4β7 integrin, this antibody may not impede the entry of
proinﬂammatory cells in joints. In fact, it may even contribute to higher
inﬂux of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who
observed de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated
IBD patients (Diaz et al., 2020). An increased incidence of extra-
intestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also
been observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims
database (Dubinsky et al., 2018). However, by improving disease activity
these drugs could still have an indirect impact on associated EIM, mostly
peripheral arthritis, as suggested by the recent EMOTIVE retrospective
analysis (Kopylov et al., 2021). Ustekinumab, however, has also limited","deﬁciencies, altered eating habits, inﬂammatory cytokines,
and corticosteroid use. Marked growth impairment at
diagnosis, deﬁned as a height z-score < –2.5, is a poor
prognostic sign.31 Furthermore, IBD patients exhibit “catch
up” growth beyond the typically expected age for growth

male patients with CD, 1.9 years and male patients with UC,
2.5 years; female patients with CD: 2.6 years and female
patients with UC, 2.8 years), suggesting that achieving
remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for
maximal growth potential.18
Early Management Can Alter Disease Course and
Prevent Complications
Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD
complications are mitigated by early treatment and remis-
sion. In the long-term follow-up data from the CALM trial,
patients with early CD who achieved deep remission,
compared to those who did not, had a signiﬁcantly lower","Numerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis
is tied to adverse outcomes in both CD and UC.41 In CD,
being diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associated
with an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–
3.6) of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, including
higher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,
and disease recurrence.42,43 In UC, younger age at diagnosis
is linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-
rectal cancer.44,45 There are conﬂicting data on the disease
course in the very-early-onset IBD population of patients
diagnosed before age 6 years, with studies reporting both
similar
and
worse
outcomes
in
very-early-onset
IBD
compared to the general pediatric population.46 Similar to
the youngest patients with IBD, elderly-onset IBD (diag-
nosed at 60–65 years of age) has conﬂicting evidence on
prognosis, with 1 study reporting fewer hospitalizations and
less frequent requirement of immunosuppression in pa-","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

observed de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","interventions and treatment with biologics and immunomodulators
(Ryan et al., 2019). Only two studies investigated the direct effect of
biological agents on sarcopenia: the ﬁrst reported an improvement of
quadriceps muscle volume and strength in CD patients after 25 weeks of
inﬂiximab treatment (Subramaniam et al., 2015), whereas Csontos et al.
observed that UC and CD patients on anti-TNF agents had an improve-
ment in fat free mass index after 12 week already (Csontos et al., 2016).
3.2.2. Disease duration, phenotype, genetics, biomarkers, and extraintestinal
manifestations
Short duration of disease has long been associated with better
response to inﬂiximab as well as other anti-TNF agents. This was reported
in the ﬁrst pediatric randomized trial by Hyams et al., which yielded
better response and remission rates than observed in adults with longer
duration of disease. This observation later conﬁrmed in others pediatric","2

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the",1,0.3

represent an important cause of morbidity and disability (Vavricka et al.,
2011; Juillerat et al., 2020). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect
30% of patients. They include non-inﬂammatory joint pain as well as
inﬂammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as
spondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, inﬂiximab and later

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","2

higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus

modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more","2

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel",2,0.2

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking

In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease

Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers","months (IQR, 1–24 months), respectively. Adults were more
likely to present with strictures (P < .001) and require
bowel surgery (P < .001). Furthermore, the duration of
diagnostic delay has been associated with complications
such as strictures and internal ﬁstulae.25 In a study, of adult
CD patients in France, delay in diagnosis longer than 13
months was associated with higher risk of a major surgery
(P ¼ .05).26
Evidence of Disease Activity Before Diagnosis
There is a signiﬁcant increase in gastrointestinal symp-
toms before IBD diagnosis (9.6% and 10.4% 5 years before
CD and UC diagnosis, respectively, compared with 5.8% of
controls).27 In addition, patients who were diagnosed with
irritable bowel syndrome or depression were less likely to
receive timely specialist referral (irritable bowel syndrome:
hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 0.60–
0.99, depression: HR, 0.77, 95% CI, 0.60–0.98), suggesting

with an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–
3.6) of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, including
higher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,
and disease recurrence.42,43 In UC, younger age at diagnosis
is linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-
rectal cancer.44,45 There are conﬂicting data on the disease
course in the very-early-onset IBD population of patients
diagnosed before age 6 years, with studies reporting both

the youngest patients with IBD, elderly-onset IBD (diag-
nosed at 60–65 years of age) has conﬂicting evidence on
prognosis, with 1 study reporting fewer hospitalizations and
less frequent requirement of immunosuppression in pa-","deﬁciencies, altered eating habits, inﬂammatory cytokines,
and corticosteroid use. Marked growth impairment at
diagnosis, deﬁned as a height z-score < –2.5, is a poor
prognostic sign.31 Furthermore, IBD patients exhibit “catch
up” growth beyond the typically expected age for growth
plate closure (median additional years to reach adult height:
male patients with CD, 1.9 years and male patients with UC,
2.5 years; female patients with CD: 2.6 years and female
patients with UC, 2.8 years), suggesting that achieving
remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for
maximal growth potential.18
Early Management Can Alter Disease Course and
Prevent Complications
Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD
complications are mitigated by early treatment and remis-
sion. In the long-term follow-up data from the CALM trial,
patients with early CD who achieved deep remission,
compared to those who did not, had a signiﬁcantly lower","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years

stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","potentially more efficacious for moderate to severely active UC than existing licensed

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more","antagonist

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative

Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as

A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line

tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative

they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-

by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","deﬁciencies, altered eating habits, inﬂammatory cytokines,
and corticosteroid use. Marked growth impairment at
diagnosis, deﬁned as a height z-score < –2.5, is a poor
prognostic sign.31 Furthermore, IBD patients exhibit “catch
up” growth beyond the typically expected age for growth
plate closure (median additional years to reach adult height:
male patients with CD, 1.9 years and male patients with UC,
2.5 years; female patients with CD: 2.6 years and female
patients with UC, 2.8 years), suggesting that achieving
remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for
maximal growth potential.18
Early Management Can Alter Disease Course and
Prevent Complications
Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD

In the last 10 years small molecules, which can be administered orally and on a daily
basis, have also been evaluated in moderate to severe UC. These include janus kinase
inhibitors, such as tofacitinib,[20] and the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator,
ozanimod.[21] The comparative efficacy and safety of all these drugs has been assessed in
prior network meta-analyses.[22, 23] These demonstrated that infliximab was ranked highest
overall for efficacy, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
previous anti-TNF-α exposure. However, this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already
several newer drugs that have shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not
considered in these network meta-analyses.[24-26] We have therefore performed an updated

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","gReasons for discontinuation of prior anti-TNF therapy: primary nonresponse, 58%; secondary loss of response, 40%; intolerance, 2%.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","antagonist

and corticosteroid use. Marked growth impairment at
diagnosis, deﬁned as a height z-score < –2.5, is a poor
prognostic sign.31 Furthermore, IBD patients exhibit “catch

plate closure (median additional years to reach adult height:
male patients with CD, 1.9 years and male patients with UC,
2.5 years; female patients with CD: 2.6 years and female
patients with UC, 2.8 years), suggesting that achieving
remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for
maximal growth potential.18
Early Management Can Alter Disease Course and
Prevent Complications
Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD
complications are mitigated by early treatment and remis-
sion. In the long-term follow-up data from the CALM trial,
patients with early CD who achieved deep remission,
compared to those who did not, had a signiﬁcantly lower","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and","Numerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis
is tied to adverse outcomes in both CD and UC.41 In CD,
being diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associated
with an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–
3.6) of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, including
higher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,

is linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-

higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-

targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","2

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the","months (IQR, 1–24 months), respectively. Adults were more
likely to present with strictures (P < .001) and require
bowel surgery (P < .001). Furthermore, the duration of
diagnostic delay has been associated with complications
such as strictures and internal ﬁstulae.25 In a study, of adult
CD patients in France, delay in diagnosis longer than 13
months was associated with higher risk of a major surgery
(P ¼ .05).26
Evidence of Disease Activity Before Diagnosis
There is a signiﬁcant increase in gastrointestinal symp-
toms before IBD diagnosis (9.6% and 10.4% 5 years before
CD and UC diagnosis, respectively, compared with 5.8% of
controls).27 In addition, patients who were diagnosed with
irritable bowel syndrome or depression were less likely to
receive timely specialist referral (irritable bowel syndrome:

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–

Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","CD.71,72
Fecal Calprotectin
Stool markers of inﬂammation, of which FC is the
most widely used, are more speciﬁc for bowel inﬂam-
mation compared to serum markers.73 FC is limited by
patients’ reticence to collect stool and lack of speciﬁcity
for IBD, but it remains an important tool for stratifying
newly diagnosed patients with IBD for risk of progres-
sion and response to ﬁrst therapy. Practically, it is
important to discuss the collection with patients, high-
lighting that the sample can be from any time, only a
small amount of stool is necessary for the analysis and,
given instability at room temperature leading to falsely
low values, it should be remitted to the laboratory

unexpectedly high, it is appropriate to repeat based on
clinical judgment, as there can be variability among
measurements within the same individual even on the","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or

Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","months (IQR, 1–24 months), respectively. Adults were more

CD patients in France, delay in diagnosis longer than 13
months was associated with higher risk of a major surgery

Evidence of Disease Activity Before Diagnosis
There is a signiﬁcant increase in gastrointestinal symp-

CD and UC diagnosis, respectively, compared with 5.8% of

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of

incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more",5,0.9

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more","Burr et al.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Therapeutic strategies for the management of recentlydiagnosedulcerative colitis.

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the","semi-systematic review suggest that IBD cutaneous lesions may respond
to the newer IBD drugs. This is the case for ustekinumab and less
frequently for vedolizumab (Phillips et al., 2020; Ben Abdallah et al.,
2021). Uveitis also appears to respond to anti-TNF agents (Leal et al.,
2019), whereas no biological agents, despite high expectations for
vedolizumab, has shown efﬁcacy in primary sclerosing cholangitis
(Christensen et al., 2018; Lynch et al., 2020).
Fistula development affects up to 50% of CD patients over 20 years of
disease course. Half of these patients experience perianal ﬁstula (Rub-
bino et al., 2021). After surgical drainage of pelvic sepsis, medical ther-
apy may be undertaken. Best results so far are obtained with anti-TNF
agents. Among them, only inﬂiximab has been evaluated in a large,
dedicated placebo-randomized trial. Out of 366 patients who received

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","upadacitinib induction therapy in patients with moderately to

uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the","adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab,
etrolizumab,
tofacitinib,
filgotinib,
ozanimod,
and
upadacitinib. Evidence regarding the induction of clinical
remission, endoscopic improvement, and safety outcomes
from 29 studies was synthesised, and indirect comparisons
between therapies were made. Since the most recent
systematic review was published,13 a large amount of new
data involving novel compounds has become available.
This sheer increase in the number of therapeutic options
for ulcerative colitis makes frequent updates of indirect
comparisons useful in the clinical setting.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

to the newer IBD drugs. This is the case for ustekinumab and less
frequently for vedolizumab (Phillips et al., 2020; Ben Abdallah et al.,
2021). Uveitis also appears to respond to anti-TNF agents (Leal et al.,
2019), whereas no biological agents, despite high expectations for
vedolizumab, has shown efﬁcacy in primary sclerosing cholangitis
(Christensen et al., 2018; Lynch et al., 2020).
Fistula development affects up to 50% of CD patients over 20 years of
disease course. Half of these patients experience perianal ﬁstula (Rub-
bino et al., 2021). After surgical drainage of pelvic sepsis, medical ther-
apy may be undertaken. Best results so far are obtained with anti-TNF
agents. Among them, only inﬂiximab has been evaluated in a large,
dedicated placebo-randomized trial. Out of 366 patients who received
induction with 5 mg/kg inﬂiximab at Week 0, 2 and 6, 195 responders","multicenter retrospective study reported the outcome of patients with
late CD who had failed treatment with one anti-TNF agent and either
vedolizumab or ustekinumab. After 48 weeks on a third line of biologic
therapy the remission rate was 30.7% whereas the surgery rate was
23.5% (Kassouri et al., 2020).
There is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD
patients. During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to re-
sponders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R,
and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T
cells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests
that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor
agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019)
when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have
occurred.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","2013;

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","diagnostic

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","include normalization of biomarkers as a short-term target
following the landmark CALM trial.23 CALM, a randomized
controlled trial of 244 patients with recently diagnosed
moderate to severe CD treated with TNFi early in their
disease course, showed a treat-to-target strategy of esca-
lating TNFi and thiopurine therapy based on clinical
symptoms and biomarker normalization resulted in more
patients achieving the primary end point (mucosal healing
[Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity <4] with
absence of deep ulcers) at week 48 compared to using
clinical symptoms alone (adjusted risk difference, 16.1%;
95% CI, 3.9–28.3; P ¼ .010).129 The long-term extension of
CALM has further demonstrated that attainment of target
goals of either endoscopic or deep remission by week 48 led
to reduction in progression of disease during a median 3
years’ follow-up.32

sample to measure FC, there is increasing interest in","In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease

course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease

Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","antagonist

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (gardenia): a

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","upadacitinib induction therapy in patients with moderately to

trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","the use of JAK inhibitors, although, until further evidence
becomes available, caution is advised when considering
JAK inhibitors as treatment options, especially in patients
with known risk factors for thrombosis. Selective JAK-1
inhibitors, such as upadacitinib and filgotinib, were
developed to improve the risk–benefit profile of this
therapeutic class.44 However, in our study, upadacitinib
was ranked highest for all adverse events and filgotinib
was ranked third highest among active interventions (ie,
not including placebo) for serious adverse events,
opposing this notion.
Representing a surprising finding of this study,
ozanimod ranked highest for the occurrence of serious
adverse events. Ozanimod is a selective sphingosine
1-phosphate modulator approved for the treatment of
multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis in the USA. Another
meta-analysis showed that sphingosine 1-phosphate
modulators are associated with an increased risk of herpes","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.",10,0.7

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,

(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","deﬁciencies, altered eating habits, inﬂammatory cytokines,
and corticosteroid use. Marked growth impairment at
diagnosis, deﬁned as a height z-score < –2.5, is a poor
prognostic sign.31 Furthermore, IBD patients exhibit “catch

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Burr et al.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","for

comparisons and network of trials are shown in Figure 1.
Trial and patient characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. Overall, the median average age of patients was
41 years (interquartile range, 40–42 y), and 60%
(interquartile range, 56%–63%) were men. The median
disease duration was 6.7 years (interquartile range,
6.0–7.8 y), and 49% (interquartile range, 46%–55%) of
patients had extensive colitis. A median of 40% (inter-
quartile range, 30%–50%) of patients were treated with
concomitant immunomodulators, and 51% (interquartile
range, 45%–57%) were on corticosteroids at baseline.
Patients across all trials and treatment arms were com-
parable in terms of baseline prognostic variables, inclu-
sion/exclusion
criteria,
and
co-interventions.
All","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially

economic burden.2,3

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (gardenia): a

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Burr et al.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-

by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

tenance (26–66 weeks) separately for treat-through (TT) and
re-randomized responders (RR) randomized clinical trials
(RCTs). Both studies also assessed all outcomes in overall
populations, as well as induction efficacy outcomes by prior
biologic exposure, though UPA was excluded from subgroup
analyses in Lasa et al11 due to lack of published data.
Despite these recent publications, there remain key gaps
in our understanding of the comparative efficacy and safety
of advanced therapies for moderately to severely active UC.
First, an indirect comparison of maintenance treatment
safety remains unpublished. Second, so far only separate
NMAs have been conducted for induction and maintenance
treatments, when in practice clinicians would consider the
overall comparative efficacy of treatments across induction
and maintenance in their decision-making. Finally, Lasa et","and

comparing standard- vs high-dose adalimumab in pa-
tients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis failed to
show the superiority of higher-dose adalimumab, sug-
gesting that currently approved dosing of adalimumab is
unlikely to change, and, hence, the comparative efﬁcacy
results will remain similar.31 Our ﬁndings also support
the observation in the recent head-to-head VARSITY trial
as well as propensity score-matched analyses from the
VICTORY consortium that vedolizumab is more effective
than adalimumab for long-term maintenance of clinical
remission; over 8 to 12 weeks of induction therapy,
however, no differences were observed between the 2
agents.6,32 Moreover, we did not observe any differences","vs adalimumab: OR, 11.05; 95% CI, 1.79–68.41; moderate CE). Vedolizumab had the lowest risk
of infections (SUCRA, 0.81), followed by ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.63) in maintenance trials.
CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision making with greater conﬁdence.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","and

different dosing schema (weight-based vs ﬁxed dose)
and route of administration. The recent Study to Evaluate
the Safety and Efﬁcacy of Two Drug Regimens in Subjects
With Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis-UC trial
comparing standard- vs high-dose adalimumab in pa-
tients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis failed to
show the superiority of higher-dose adalimumab, sug-
gesting that currently approved dosing of adalimumab is
unlikely to change, and, hence, the comparative efﬁcacy
results will remain similar.31 Our ﬁndings also support
the observation in the recent head-to-head VARSITY trial
as well as propensity score-matched analyses from the
VICTORY consortium that vedolizumab is more effective
than adalimumab for long-term maintenance of clinical
remission; over 8 to 12 weeks of induction therapy,
however, no differences were observed between the 2
agents.6,32 Moreover, we did not observe any differences","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

populations, as well as induction efficacy outcomes by prior
biologic exposure, though UPA was excluded from subgroup
analyses in Lasa et al11 due to lack of published data.
Despite these recent publications, there remain key gaps
in our understanding of the comparative efficacy and safety
of advanced therapies for moderately to severely active UC.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked
according to their P-score.
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,","adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab,

RESULTS:","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked
according to their P-score.
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,",13,0.5

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety

Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","Burr et al.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as

RESULTS:","semi-systematic review suggest that IBD cutaneous lesions may respond
to the newer IBD drugs. This is the case for ustekinumab and less
frequently for vedolizumab (Phillips et al., 2020; Ben Abdallah et al.,
2021). Uveitis also appears to respond to anti-TNF agents (Leal et al.,
2019), whereas no biological agents, despite high expectations for
vedolizumab, has shown efﬁcacy in primary sclerosing cholangitis

Fistula development affects up to 50% of CD patients over 20 years of
disease course. Half of these patients experience perianal ﬁstula (Rub-
bino et al., 2021). After surgical drainage of pelvic sepsis, medical ther-
apy may be undertaken. Best results so far are obtained with anti-TNF
agents. Among them, only inﬂiximab has been evaluated in a large,

population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and
waning, but the underlying systemic inﬂammation can lead
to progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinal
damage

not

adequately.15
Complications
associated
with
ongoing
inﬂammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, ﬁstulas,

include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and
colorectal cancer.2,4,17 Other complications include anemia,

sive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inﬂamma-

eases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-
tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the

by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares
and
hospitalizations
requiring
immunosuppressive
therapies and corticosteroids, and impose a signiﬁcant
direct and indirect economic burden in population-
based cohorts.2,3 Several treatment options now are
available
for
the
management
of
moderate–severe
ulcerative colitis, with variable efﬁcacy and safety pro-
ﬁles, and positioning different agents in the treatment
course as ﬁrst-line (in biologic-naïve patients) and

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.
Key Words: ulcerative colitis, clinical trials, advanced therapies, network meta-analysis
Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel",15,0.4

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares
and
hospitalizations
requiring
immunosuppressive
therapies and corticosteroids, and impose a signiﬁcant
direct and indirect economic burden in population-
based cohorts.2,3 Several treatment options now are

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","in induction trials, we estimated that 58.7%, 40.4%,

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","gReasons for discontinuation of prior anti-TNF therapy: primary nonresponse, 58%; secondary loss of response, 40%; intolerance, 2%.

Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","semi-systematic review suggest that IBD cutaneous lesions may respond
to the newer IBD drugs. This is the case for ustekinumab and less
frequently for vedolizumab (Phillips et al., 2020; Ben Abdallah et al.,
2021). Uveitis also appears to respond to anti-TNF agents (Leal et al.,
2019), whereas no biological agents, despite high expectations for
vedolizumab, has shown efﬁcacy in primary sclerosing cholangitis
(Christensen et al., 2018; Lynch et al., 2020).
Fistula development affects up to 50% of CD patients over 20 years of
disease course. Half of these patients experience perianal ﬁstula (Rub-
bino et al., 2021). After surgical drainage of pelvic sepsis, medical ther-
apy may be undertaken. Best results so far are obtained with anti-TNF
agents. Among them, only inﬂiximab has been evaluated in a large,
dedicated placebo-randomized trial. Out of 366 patients who received
induction with 5 mg/kg inﬂiximab at Week 0, 2 and 6, 195 responders","Colitis, 2020. Comorbidity, not patient age, is associated with impaired safety

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (gardenia): a

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","353:2462–2476.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (gardenia): a

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","immunomodulators (severe disease,

• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares
and
hospitalizations
requiring
immunosuppressive
therapies and corticosteroids, and impose a signiﬁcant
direct and indirect economic burden in population-
based cohorts.2,3 Several treatment options now are
available

of

ulcerative colitis, with variable efﬁcacy and safety pro-
ﬁles, and positioning different agents in the treatment

individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","cumulative ranking (SUCRA), which represents the per-
centage of efﬁcacy or safety achieved by an agent
compared with an imaginary agent that is always the
best without uncertainty (ie, SUCRA ¼ 100%).16 Higher
SUCRA scores correspond to higher ranking for induction
of clinical remission and/or endoscopic improvement,
and higher ranking for safety (ie, lowest risk of serious
adverse events and infections).
Conﬁdence in Estimates
We followed the GRADE approach to appraise the
conﬁdence in estimates derived from network meta-
analysis of efﬁcacy outcomes.8 In this approach, direct
evidence from RCTs starts at high conﬁdence and can be
rated down based on risk of bias, indirectness, impreci-
sion, inconsistency (or heterogeneity), and/or publica-
tion bias, to levels of moderate, low, and very low
conﬁdence. The rating of indirect estimates starts at the
lowest rating of the 2 pairwise estimates that contribute
as ﬁrst-order loops to the indirect estimate but can be","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel",19,0.3

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal

trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety

sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","antagonist

The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and

ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking","Articles

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-

by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","AND [“ulcerative colitis” OR “inflammatory bowel disease”] AND
[“efficacy” OR “safety” OR “adverse events”]. Additionally, we
manually reviewed major congresses’ databases (European
Crohn’s and Colitis Organization, Digestive Disease Week, and
United European Gastroenterology Week) from Jan 1, 2018, to
July 3, 2021. With the paucity of direct head-to-head trials,
indirect comparisons have become useful in the clinic to
determine drug positioning. Several network meta-analyses
have compared approved therapeutic options for ulcerative
colitis, but did not include recent data on the small molecule
drugs ozanimod, filgotinib, and upadacitinib.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, we are the first to include the novel drugs
ozanimod, filgotinib, upadacitinib, and etrolizumab in a
systematic review and network meta-analysis of treatments for
ulcerative colitis. Additionally, we analysed steroid-free

Additionally, subcutaneous formulations of infliximab
and vedolizumab were approved by the European
Medicines Agency in 2020 for the treatment of ulcerative
colitis and Crohn’s disease. The aim of this systematic

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares
and
hospitalizations

immunosuppressive
therapies and corticosteroids, and impose a signiﬁcant

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

comparing the efﬁcacy between all available biologics is addressed
(Singh et al., 2021). The conclusion was that in biologic-naïve patients
with moderate to severely active CD, inﬂiximab, adalimumab, and
ustekinumab are the most effective compared to vedolizumab and cer-
tolizumab pegol. Inﬂiximab was considered the strongest for induction.
However, in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to inﬂiximab),
the beneﬁt of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain. A
summary of the efﬁcacies of the various biological agents, according to
the line of treatment and previous treatment failures and patients'
phenotype, is provided in Table 2. The ﬁnal word about the efﬁcacy of

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

to the newer IBD drugs. This is the case for ustekinumab and less
frequently for vedolizumab (Phillips et al., 2020; Ben Abdallah et al.,
2021). Uveitis also appears to respond to anti-TNF agents (Leal et al.,
2019), whereas no biological agents, despite high expectations for
vedolizumab, has shown efﬁcacy in primary sclerosing cholangitis

apy may be undertaken. Best results so far are obtained with anti-TNF
agents. Among them, only inﬂiximab has been evaluated in a large,

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most

(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","353:2462–2476.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Burr et al.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","include normalization of biomarkers as a short-term target

controlled trial of 244 patients with recently diagnosed
moderate to severe CD treated with TNFi early in their
disease course, showed a treat-to-target strategy of esca-
lating TNFi and thiopurine therapy based on clinical
symptoms and biomarker normalization resulted in more
patients achieving the primary end point (mucosal healing
[Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity <4] with
absence of deep ulcers) at week 48 compared to using
clinical symptoms alone (adjusted risk difference, 16.1%;
95% CI, 3.9–28.3; P ¼ .010).129 The long-term extension of
CALM has further demonstrated that attainment of target
goals of either endoscopic or deep remission by week 48 led
to reduction in progression of disease during a median 3
years’ follow-up.32

trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","353:2462–2476.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and

and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","meta-analysis. Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2022.07.032

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","353:2462–2476.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","antagonist

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality

variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease

Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","(P A Olivera); Gastroenterology

The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and

• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed

• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor

Data from the literature on strategies to position biological therapy is
scarce. Guidance and consensus statements exist to help aid the decision
making process. However there is a tendency to position all biologics on
the same level and to consider them as interchangeable in the ECCO
Guidelines (Torres et al., 2020; Raine et al., 2021). These guidelines, used

perform their own) to extract the necessary data to answer speciﬁc (so

(Raine et al., 2021)).

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel",23,0.5

• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (gardenia): a

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings

colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings

of infections (SUCRA, 0.81), followed by ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.63) in maintenance trials.
CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","network

comparative efﬁcacy of different agents in biologic-
naïve patients and in patients with prior exposure to
TNFa antagonists for management of moderate–severe
ulcerative
colitis.

in
these
meta-
analyses were phase II or III randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","2013;

manifestations occur in up to 15% of IBD patients (Vavricka et al., 2011).
The most common, erythema nodosum, depends on the underlying dis-
ease activity, whereas pyoderma gangrenosum may be associated with
active or inactive intestinal disease and requires rapid management, most
commonly with systemic medication. Treatment includes oral cortico-
steroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and anti-TNF therapy (inﬂiximab or
adalimumab), drugs that have good efﬁcacy in several cases reports and
small case series (Juillerat et al., 2007). Cases reports and a recent
semi-systematic review suggest that IBD cutaneous lesions may respond
to the newer IBD drugs. This is the case for ustekinumab and less","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to

or
pancolitis
is
associated
with

In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","were signiﬁcantly different (Table 2). Overall, inﬂiximab

tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line

greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as

they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","What You Need to Know

Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-

Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","Tsapas A. Systematic review with network meta-analysis: the impact

continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the

(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1

third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3

colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of

and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and

ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking

In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease

other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal

trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares

The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking","antagonist

moderate–severe ulcerative colitis. The size of the nodes and
the thickness of the edges are weighted according to the
number of studies evaluating each treatment and direct
comparison, respectively.

Management of Moderate–Severe UC 2181","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel",28,0

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Therapeutic strategies for the management of recentlydiagnosedulcerative colitis.

trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options

may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-

P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Tsapas A. Systematic review with network meta-analysis: the impact

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (gardenia): a

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","antagonist

Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","upadacitinib induction therapy in patients with moderately to

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","Therapeutic strategies for the management of recentlydiagnosedulcerative colitis. IMMs include thiopurines and methotrexate. 5-ASA, 5-amino salicylic acid; ASUC, acute severe ulcerative colitis; IPAA, ileal pouch anal anastomosis.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review
