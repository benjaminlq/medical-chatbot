Extraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and
represent an important cause of morbidity and disability (Vavricka et al.,

30% of patients. They include non-inﬂammatory joint pain as well as
inﬂammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as
spondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, inﬂiximab and later

(little to no symptoms and low inﬂammatory markers) may

should be managed more proactively and aggressively. We

patients with UC, 2.8 years), suggesting that achieving
remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for
maximal growth potential.18
Early Management Can Alter Disease Course and
Prevent Complications
Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD

(little to no symptoms and low inﬂammatory markers) may

male patients with CD, 1.9 years and male patients with UC,
2.5 years; female patients with CD: 2.6 years and female
patients with UC, 2.8 years), suggesting that achieving
remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for
maximal growth potential.18
Early Management Can Alter Disease Course and
Prevent Complications
Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD
complications are mitigated by early treatment and remis-
sion. In the long-term follow-up data from the CALM trial,

30% of patients. They include non-inﬂammatory joint pain as well as
inﬂammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as
spondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, inﬂiximab and later
the other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD

in both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established efﬁcacies in most
rheumatological indications (Herfarth et al., 2002; Generini et al., 2004;

remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for
maximal growth potential.18

Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD

inﬂux of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who
observed de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated
IBD patients (Diaz et al., 2020). An increased incidence of extra-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Numerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis

being diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associated
with an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–

higher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,

is linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","potentially more efficacious for moderate to severely active UC than existing licensed

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more","2

The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and

IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary

consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool

upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-

In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI

17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63

IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking

In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63

(Figure 1). For example, a patient with low disease activity
(little to no symptoms and low inﬂammatory markers) may

prognostic sign.31 Furthermore, IBD patients exhibit “catch

male patients with CD, 1.9 years and male patients with UC,
2.5 years; female patients with CD: 2.6 years and female
patients with UC, 2.8 years), suggesting that achieving
remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for
maximal growth potential.18
Early Management Can Alter Disease Course and
Prevent Complications
Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD
complications are mitigated by early treatment and remis-
sion. In the long-term follow-up data from the CALM trial,
patients with early CD who achieved deep remission,
compared to those who did not, had a signiﬁcantly lower","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,

trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking

In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63

(Figure 1). For example, a patient with low disease activity
(little to no symptoms and low inﬂammatory markers) may
actually have high severity (due to disease history or
behavior) increasing the risk for disease progression, and
should be managed more proactively and aggressively. We
will review predictors of IBD severity and activity.

prognostic sign.31 Furthermore, IBD patients exhibit “catch
up” growth beyond the typically expected age for growth

male patients with CD, 1.9 years and male patients with UC,
2.5 years; female patients with CD: 2.6 years and female
patients with UC, 2.8 years), suggesting that achieving
remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for
maximal growth potential.18
Early Management Can Alter Disease Course and
Prevent Complications
Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD
complications are mitigated by early treatment and remis-
sion. In the long-term follow-up data from the CALM trial,
patients with early CD who achieved deep remission,
compared to those who did not, had a signiﬁcantly lower","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and","associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/

disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,

usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse

remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for

Early Management Can Alter Disease Course and
Prevent Complications
Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD
complications are mitigated by early treatment and remis-
sion. In the long-term follow-up data from the CALM trial,
patients with early CD who achieved deep remission,

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,

With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and","associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.

manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or

kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more","tant variables to consider. For the purpose of this discus-

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative

Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-

highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with

Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative

they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","endoscopic improvement. An update to this work from 2020, including data from head-to-
head trials of vedolizumab and adalimumab, as well as phase III placebo-controlled trials of
ustekinumab, demonstrated again that infliximab was ranked first for induction of clinical
remission and endoscopic improvement in biologic-naïve patients, with ustekinumab and
tofacitinib ranked highest in patients previously exposed to biologics.[23] This later network
meta-analysis included 14 induction of remission trials, recruiting almost 5500 patients,
although the Japanese trial of infliximab versus placebo in 208 patients reported by
Kobayashi et al. was not included.[42] In contrast to these previous network meta-analyses,
our results provide hope that some novel drugs, which are likely to come to market soon, are
potentially more efficacious for moderate to severely active UC than existing licensed
therapies.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","What You Need to Know

higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","of

higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","of

recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-

presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to

are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","of

recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection

presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to

are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

with an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–

higher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,
and disease recurrence.42,43 In UC, younger age at diagnosis

the youngest patients with IBD, elderly-onset IBD (diag-

prognosis, with 1 study reporting fewer hospitalizations and
less frequent requirement of immunosuppression in pa-","deﬁciencies, altered eating habits, inﬂammatory cytokines,
and corticosteroid use. Marked growth impairment at
diagnosis, deﬁned as a height z-score < –2.5, is a poor
prognostic sign.31 Furthermore, IBD patients exhibit “catch
up” growth beyond the typically expected age for growth
plate closure (median additional years to reach adult height:
male patients with CD, 1.9 years and male patients with UC,
2.5 years; female patients with CD: 2.6 years and female
patients with UC, 2.8 years), suggesting that achieving
remission even after reaching adolescence may allow for
maximal growth potential.18
Early Management Can Alter Disease Course and
Prevent Complications
Data have consistently demonstrated that long-term IBD
complications are mitigated by early treatment and remis-
sion. In the long-term follow-up data from the CALM trial,
patients with early CD who achieved deep remission,
compared to those who did not, had a signiﬁcantly lower","Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives

(Figure 1). For example, a patient with low disease activity
(little to no symptoms and low inﬂammatory markers) may
actually have high severity (due to disease history or
behavior) increasing the risk for disease progression, and
should be managed more proactively and aggressively. We
will review predictors of IBD severity and activity.

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,

disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%

signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

(little to no symptoms and low inﬂammatory markers) may
actually have high severity (due to disease history or

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,

disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%

signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-

in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or

kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","Numerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more","2

The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults

For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-

biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and

there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","• Significant efect on quality of life

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","• Significant efect on quality of life

1542-3565/$36.00","Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking","hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers","Numerous studies suggest that younger age at diagnosis
is tied to adverse outcomes in both CD and UC.41 In CD,
being diagnosed before the age of 40 years is associated
with an increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–
3.6) of disabling disease 5 years after diagnosis, including
higher rates of surgery, hospitalization, steroid dependence,
and disease recurrence.42,43 In UC, younger age at diagnosis
is linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colo-
rectal cancer.44,45 There are conﬂicting data on the disease
course in the very-early-onset IBD population of patients
diagnosed before age 6 years, with studies reporting both
similar
and
worse
outcomes
in
very-early-onset
IBD
compared to the general pediatric population.46 Similar to
the youngest patients with IBD, elderly-onset IBD (diag-
nosed at 60–65 years of age) has conﬂicting evidence on
prognosis, with 1 study reporting fewer hospitalizations and
less frequent requirement of immunosuppression in pa-","antagonist

with
moderate–severe ulcerative colitis. The size of the nodes and
the thickness of the edges are weighted according to the
number of studies evaluating each treatment and direct
comparison, respectively.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","antagonist

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","antagonist

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","antagonist

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","Therapeutic strategies for the management of recentlydiagnosedulcerative colitis. IMMs include thiopurines and methotrexate. 5-ASA, 5-amino salicylic acid; ASUC, acute severe ulcerative colitis; IPAA, ileal pouch anal anastomosis.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line

ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with

would achieve induction of remission.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with

We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.
Induction of endoscopic improvement. On direct meta-
analysis, tofacitinib and ustekinumab, but not vedolizumab
or adalimumab, were superior to placebo for induction of
endoscopic improvement, with minimal heterogeneity

There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate
response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-","should be discussed adequately with patients.
Integrating ﬁndings from this meta-analysis and other
studies, current evidence favors inﬂiximab or vedolizu-
mab
as
the
preferred
ﬁrst-line
agents
for
moderate–severe ulcerative colitis. In patients who fail
inﬂiximab, ustekinumab and tofacitinib likely would be
most efﬁcacious, and ustekinumab’s superior safety
proﬁle may be attractive in light of recent concerns
around

tofacitinib.
However, besides quality of evidence, several other fac-
tors including a balance of risk–beneﬁt proﬁle, speciﬁc
patient attributes (age, comorbid conditions including
rheumatic or dermatologic diseases, and so forth), clin-
ical judgment and experience of the treating physicians,
values
and
preferences
of
patients
(dosing

regimen, acceptability of risk–beneﬁt trade-offs, and so

important to facilitate shared decision making, in devel-","(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.
Induction of endoscopic improvement. On direct meta-
analysis, tofacitinib and ustekinumab, but not vedolizumab

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Burr et al.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","(infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab), anti-integrin antibodies (vedolizumab or
etrolizumab), or anti-interleukin-12/23 antibodies (ustekinumab)) or small molecules (janus
kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, filgotinib, or upadacitinib) or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
modulators (ozanimod)) at the doses taken through into testing in phase III clinical trials.
Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the
set operator AND with studies identified with the following terms: infliximab, remicade,","tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; UC, ulcerative colitis; UST, ustekinumab;
VDZ, vedolizumab.

REVIEWS AND
PERSPECTIVES","multicenter retrospective study reported the outcome of patients with
late CD who had failed treatment with one anti-TNF agent and either
vedolizumab or ustekinumab. After 48 weeks on a third line of biologic
therapy the remission rate was 30.7% whereas the surgery rate was
23.5% (Kassouri et al., 2020).
There is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD
patients. During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to re-
sponders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R,
and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T
cells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests
that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor
agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019)
when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have
occurred.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.
Induction of endoscopic improvement. On direct meta-
analysis, tofacitinib and ustekinumab, but not vedolizumab
or adalimumab, were superior to placebo for induction of
endoscopic improvement, with minimal heterogeneity

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","antagonist

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","antagonist

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","antagonist

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","• Significant efect on quality of life

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","• Significant efect on quality of life

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","• Significant efect on quality of life

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an

tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.

needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,",11,0.7

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","antagonist
exposure
with
moderate–severe ulcerative colitis. The size of the nodes and
the thickness of the edges are weighted according to the
number of studies evaluating each treatment and direct
comparison, respectively.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","Tsapas A. Systematic review with network meta-analysis: the impact

Discussion
We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs
of biologics and small molecule drugs (approved or in a
late stage of development) for induction and maintenance
treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative
colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics,
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety,
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in
terms of adverse events and serious adverse events, as
previously
observed","(ie, tofacitinib, ozanimod, filgotinib, and upadacitinib).
Fifth, we analysed steroid-free remission—a more robust
and
clinically
meaningful
outcome
than
clinical
remission—in maintenance trials only, as corticosteroid
tapering was not allowed in induction trials. In addition,
not all clinical trials reported on steroid-free remission,
particularly the older trials. Finally, some preliminary
reports, such as the trial of maintenance with subcutaneous
vedolizumab, did not report relevant data for endoscopic
improvement.
As with any indirect comparison, the results presented
in this study should be interpreted with caution but could
help clinicians to navigate the current scenario in which
the number of therapeutic options for moderate-to-
severe ulcerative colitis is steadily increasing. These
findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating,
until direct comparisons by means of head-to-head trials
become available to fully elucidate the positioning of","tive colitis. Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2018;47:454–465.

CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision making with greater conﬁdence.

We conducted 2 separate pairwise and network

naïve patients and in patients with prior exposure to
TNFa antagonists for management of moderate–severe
ulcerative
colitis.

severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,
with a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)
comparator: another active intervention or placebo;","subsequent trials of vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and uste-
kinumab, a signiﬁcant proportion of patients may have
been exposed to 2 or more biologic agents before clinical
trial intervention, and inherently may be difﬁcult to treat.

tients in these trials failed multiple TNFa antagonists and
vedolizumab, conceivably making it a more refractory

riority of ustekinumab over vedolizumab, suggesting the
effect likely is real and not confounded by treatment
refractoriness.

Discussion
We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs
of biologics and small molecule drugs (approved or in a
late stage of development) for induction and maintenance
treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative
colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics,
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety,
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in
terms of adverse events and serious adverse events, as
previously
observed","(ie, tofacitinib, ozanimod, filgotinib, and upadacitinib).
Fifth, we analysed steroid-free remission—a more robust
and
clinically
meaningful
outcome
than
clinical
remission—in maintenance trials only, as corticosteroid
tapering was not allowed in induction trials. In addition,
not all clinical trials reported on steroid-free remission,
particularly the older trials. Finally, some preliminary
reports, such as the trial of maintenance with subcutaneous
vedolizumab, did not report relevant data for endoscopic
improvement.
As with any indirect comparison, the results presented
in this study should be interpreted with caution but could
help clinicians to navigate the current scenario in which
the number of therapeutic options for moderate-to-
severe ulcerative colitis is steadily increasing. These
findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating,
until direct comparisons by means of head-to-head trials
become available to fully elucidate the positioning of","tive colitis. Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2018;47:454–465.

CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision making with greater conﬁdence.

Study Selection
We conducted 2 separate pairwise and network
meta-analyses of induction therapy to estimate the
comparative efﬁcacy of different agents in biologic-
naïve patients and in patients with prior exposure to
TNFa antagonists for management of moderate–severe
ulcerative
colitis.
Studies
included
in
these
meta-
analyses were phase II or III randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,
with a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)
comparator: another active intervention or placebo;","subsequent trials of vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and uste-
kinumab, a signiﬁcant proportion of patients may have
been exposed to 2 or more biologic agents before clinical
trial intervention, and inherently may be difﬁcult to treat.
However,
trials
of
ustekinumab
were
conducted
following approval of vedolizumab, and a subset of pa-
tients in these trials failed multiple TNFa antagonists and
vedolizumab, conceivably making it a more refractory
patient population. Despite this, we observed the supe-
riority of ustekinumab over vedolizumab, suggesting the
effect likely is real and not confounded by treatment
refractoriness.

of ustekinumab, accounting for dose change for tofaciti-

Discussion
We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs
of biologics and small molecule drugs (approved or in a
late stage of development) for induction and maintenance
treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative
colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics,
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety,
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in
terms of adverse events and serious adverse events, as
previously
observed","(ie, tofacitinib, ozanimod, filgotinib, and upadacitinib).
Fifth, we analysed steroid-free remission—a more robust
and
clinically
meaningful
outcome
than
clinical
remission—in maintenance trials only, as corticosteroid
tapering was not allowed in induction trials. In addition,
not all clinical trials reported on steroid-free remission,
particularly the older trials. Finally, some preliminary
reports, such as the trial of maintenance with subcutaneous
vedolizumab, did not report relevant data for endoscopic
improvement.
As with any indirect comparison, the results presented
in this study should be interpreted with caution but could
help clinicians to navigate the current scenario in which
the number of therapeutic options for moderate-to-
severe ulcerative colitis is steadily increasing. These
findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating,
until direct comparisons by means of head-to-head trials
become available to fully elucidate the positioning of","tive colitis. Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2018;47:454–465.

CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision making with greater conﬁdence.

Study Selection
We conducted 2 separate pairwise and network

comparative efﬁcacy of different agents in biologic-
naïve patients and in patients with prior exposure to
TNFa antagonists for management of moderate–severe
ulcerative
colitis.

trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,
with a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)
comparator: another active intervention or placebo;","subsequent trials of vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and uste-
kinumab, a signiﬁcant proportion of patients may have
been exposed to 2 or more biologic agents before clinical
trial intervention, and inherently may be difﬁcult to treat.
However,
trials
of

conducted
following approval of vedolizumab, and a subset of pa-
tients in these trials failed multiple TNFa antagonists and
vedolizumab, conceivably making it a more refractory
patient population. Despite this, we observed the supe-
riority of ustekinumab over vedolizumab, suggesting the
effect likely is real and not confounded by treatment
refractoriness.

Discussion
We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs
of biologics and small molecule drugs (approved or in a
late stage of development) for induction and maintenance
treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative
colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics,
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety,
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in
terms of adverse events and serious adverse events, as
previously
observed","(ie, tofacitinib, ozanimod, filgotinib, and upadacitinib).
Fifth, we analysed steroid-free remission—a more robust
and
clinically
meaningful
outcome
than
clinical
remission—in maintenance trials only, as corticosteroid
tapering was not allowed in induction trials. In addition,
not all clinical trials reported on steroid-free remission,
particularly the older trials. Finally, some preliminary
reports, such as the trial of maintenance with subcutaneous
vedolizumab, did not report relevant data for endoscopic
improvement.
As with any indirect comparison, the results presented
in this study should be interpreted with caution but could
help clinicians to navigate the current scenario in which
the number of therapeutic options for moderate-to-
severe ulcerative colitis is steadily increasing. These
findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating,
until direct comparisons by means of head-to-head trials
become available to fully elucidate the positioning of","tive colitis. Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2018;47:454–465.

CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision making with greater conﬁdence.

Discussion
We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs
of biologics and small molecule drugs (approved or in a
late stage of development) for induction and maintenance
treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative
colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics,
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety,
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in
terms of adverse events and serious adverse events, as
previously
observed","(ie, tofacitinib, ozanimod, filgotinib, and upadacitinib).
Fifth, we analysed steroid-free remission—a more robust
and
clinically
meaningful
outcome
than
clinical
remission—in maintenance trials only, as corticosteroid
tapering was not allowed in induction trials. In addition,
not all clinical trials reported on steroid-free remission,
particularly the older trials. Finally, some preliminary
reports, such as the trial of maintenance with subcutaneous
vedolizumab, did not report relevant data for endoscopic
improvement.
As with any indirect comparison, the results presented
in this study should be interpreted with caution but could
help clinicians to navigate the current scenario in which
the number of therapeutic options for moderate-to-
severe ulcerative colitis is steadily increasing. These
findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating,
until direct comparisons by means of head-to-head trials
become available to fully elucidate the positioning of","tive colitis. Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2018;47:454–465.

Study Selection
We conducted 2 separate pairwise and network
meta-analyses of induction therapy to estimate the
comparative efﬁcacy of different agents in biologic-
naïve patients and in patients with prior exposure to
TNFa antagonists for management of moderate–severe
ulcerative
colitis.
Studies
included
in
these
meta-
analyses were phase II or III randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,
with a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)
comparator: another active intervention or placebo;","investigators for all trials, except trials of tofacitinib and
ustekinumab, which were read by blinded central
readers.7,26 Overall, the studies were deemed to be at
low risk of bias, and all included studies were industry-
sponsored.

logic-naïve patients with moderate–severe ulcerative
colitis, treated with inﬂiximab (4 trials, 667 patients),
adalimumab (4 trials, 1046 patients), golimumab (2 tri-
als, 586 patients), vedolizumab (3 trials, 630 patients),

direct
meta-
analysis, all agents were superior to placebo for induc-
tion of clinical remission, and effect size was strongest
for inﬂiximab (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.68–6.16) and vedoli-
zumab (OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.53–6.26), with minimal to","subsequent trials of vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and uste-
kinumab, a signiﬁcant proportion of patients may have
been exposed to 2 or more biologic agents before clinical
trial intervention, and inherently may be difﬁcult to treat.
However,
trials
of
ustekinumab
were
conducted
following approval of vedolizumab, and a subset of pa-
tients in these trials failed multiple TNFa antagonists and
vedolizumab, conceivably making it a more refractory
patient population. Despite this, we observed the supe-
riority of ustekinumab over vedolizumab, suggesting the
effect likely is real and not confounded by treatment
refractoriness.

of ustekinumab, accounting for dose change for tofaciti-

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","were signiﬁcantly different (Table 2). Overall, inﬂiximab
(SUCRA, 0.95) was ranked highest for inducing clinical
remission

patients
with
moderate–severe UC (Figure 2A). With an estimated
placebo rate of achieving remission of 10% in included
trials, we anticipate that 31.1%, 17.7%, 23.7%, 22.0%,

placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","were signiﬁcantly different (Table 2). Overall, inﬂiximab
(SUCRA, 0.95) was ranked highest for inducing clinical
remission
in
biologic-naïve
patients
with
moderate–severe UC (Figure 2A). With an estimated
placebo rate of achieving remission of 10% in included
trials, we anticipate that 31.1%, 17.7%, 23.7%, 22.0%,

Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC
(Supplementary Table 1), and compared biological therapies or small molecules with
placebo, or with each other. We required a minimum follow-up duration of 6 weeks.
Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We
identified studies on UC with the terms: inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, or ulcerative
colitis (both as medical subject headings and free text terms). We combined these using the

Discussion
We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs

colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics,
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety,
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in

except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety,

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","were signiﬁcantly different (Table 2). Overall, inﬂiximab
(SUCRA, 0.95) was ranked highest for inducing clinical

We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs

colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics,
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety,

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision making with greater conﬁdence.

23.5% (Kassouri et al., 2020).
There is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD
patients. During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to re-
sponders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R,
and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T
cells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests
that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor
agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019)
when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have
occurred.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Therapeutic strategies for the management of recentlydiagnosedulcerative colitis.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,

The therapeutic armamentarium for moderate-to-severe

of treatment with biologics. In this context of ever-expanding
treatment options, frequent updates of indirect comparisons

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Therapeutic strategies for the management of recentlydiagnosedulcerative colitis.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Therapeutic strategies for the management of recentlydiagnosedulcerative colitis.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Therapeutic strategies for the management of recentlydiagnosedulcerative colitis.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,",15,0

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,",15,0.2

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,",15,0.5

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,",15,0.8

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

","(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","in induction trials, we estimated that 58.7%, 40.4%,
42.7%, 51.9%, 46.5%, and 44.4% of inﬂiximab-, adali-
mumab-, golimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofacitinib-, and
ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively, would ach-
ieve induction of endoscopic improvement.
Second-line
pharmacotherapy
for
moderate–severe
ulcerative colitis. Overall, 7 RCTs including 1580 pa-
tients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with prior
exposure to TNFa antagonists were identiﬁed. These
included subgroup analyses of trials of adalimumab,21
vedolizumab,24,25
tofacitinib,26
and
ustekinumab.7
There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate
response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-","induction of remission than prior estimates, and the
signiﬁcantly superior efﬁcacy of ustekinumab and tofa-
citinib over vedolizumab as second-line agents in pa-
tients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists. With
limited head-to-head trials, this information can inform
clinical practice and guidelines directly and facilitate
shared decision making for management of patients with
moderate–severe ulcerative colitis.

tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.
Induction of endoscopic improvement. On direct meta-
analysis, tofacitinib and ustekinumab, but not vedolizumab
or adalimumab, were superior to placebo for induction of
endoscopic improvement, with minimal heterogeneity

preferred

agents
for

around

CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision making with greater conﬁdence.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","in induction trials, we estimated that 58.7%, 40.4%,

CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision making with greater conﬁdence.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","in induction trials, we estimated that 58.7%, 40.4%,
42.7%, 51.9%, 46.5%, and 44.4% of inﬂiximab-, adali-

CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision making with greater conﬁdence.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","in induction trials, we estimated that 58.7%, 40.4%,
42.7%, 51.9%, 46.5%, and 44.4% of inﬂiximab-, adali-

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Burr et al.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","network

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","network

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","network

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse

comparative efﬁcacy of different agents in biologic-
naïve patients and in patients with prior exposure to
TNFa antagonists for management of moderate–severe
ulcerative
colitis.

analyses were phase II or III randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,
with a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)
comparator: another active intervention or placebo;","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","in induction trials, we estimated that 58.7%, 40.4%,
42.7%, 51.9%, 46.5%, and 44.4% of inﬂiximab-, adali-
mumab-, golimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofacitinib-, and

There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate
response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-","molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were
included. Phase 2 RCTs were excluded because of their small sample sizes and inclusion of doses not further explored
in phase 3 RCTs. Summary data from intention-to-treat analyses were extracted from included reports by JSL and PAO.
The primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission. A network meta-analysis was done under the frequentist
framework, obtaining pairwise odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA)
was used to rank the included agents for each outcome. Higher SUCRA scores correlate with better efficacy, whereas
lower SUCRA scores correlate with better safety. Maintenance data on efficacy for treat-straight-through and

ABSTRACT
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked
according to their P-score.
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,","and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality

ABSTRACT
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked
according to their P-score.
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,","and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality

for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,

Study Selection
We conducted 2 separate pairwise and network
meta-analyses of induction therapy to estimate the
comparative efﬁcacy of different agents in biologic-
naïve patients and in patients with prior exposure to
TNFa antagonists for management of moderate–severe
ulcerative
colitis.
Studies
included
in
these
meta-
analyses were phase II or III randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,
with a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)
comparator: another active intervention or placebo;","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","in induction trials, we estimated that 58.7%, 40.4%,
42.7%, 51.9%, 46.5%, and 44.4% of inﬂiximab-, adali-
mumab-, golimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofacitinib-, and
ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively, would ach-
ieve induction of endoscopic improvement.
Second-line
pharmacotherapy
for
moderate–severe
ulcerative colitis. Overall, 7 RCTs including 1580 pa-
tients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with prior
exposure to TNFa antagonists were identiﬁed. These
included subgroup analyses of trials of adalimumab,21
vedolizumab,24,25
tofacitinib,26
and
ustekinumab.7
There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate
response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-","molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were
included. Phase 2 RCTs were excluded because of their small sample sizes and inclusion of doses not further explored
in phase 3 RCTs. Summary data from intention-to-treat analyses were extracted from included reports by JSL and PAO.
The primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission. A network meta-analysis was done under the frequentist
framework, obtaining pairwise odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA)
was used to rank the included agents for each outcome. Higher SUCRA scores correlate with better efficacy, whereas
lower SUCRA scores correlate with better safety. Maintenance data on efficacy for treat-straight-through and
randomised responder trials are also presented. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021225329.","meta-analysis. Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2022.07.032

by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs

response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-","molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were
included. Phase 2 RCTs were excluded because of their small sample sizes and inclusion of doses not further explored
in phase 3 RCTs. Summary data from intention-to-treat analyses were extracted from included reports by JSL and PAO.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked
according to their P-score.
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,","meta-analysis. Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2022.07.032

Study Selection
We conducted 2 separate pairwise and network
meta-analyses of induction therapy to estimate the
comparative efﬁcacy of different agents in biologic-
naïve patients and in patients with prior exposure to
TNFa antagonists for management of moderate–severe
ulcerative
colitis.
Studies
included
in
these
meta-
analyses were phase II or III randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,
with a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)
comparator: another active intervention or placebo;","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","in induction trials, we estimated that 58.7%, 40.4%,
42.7%, 51.9%, 46.5%, and 44.4% of inﬂiximab-, adali-
mumab-, golimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofacitinib-, and
ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively, would ach-
ieve induction of endoscopic improvement.

for
moderate–severe
ulcerative colitis. Overall, 7 RCTs including 1580 pa-
tients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with prior
exposure to TNFa antagonists were identiﬁed. These
included subgroup analyses of trials of adalimumab,21
vedolizumab,24,25
tofacitinib,26
and
ustekinumab.7
There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate
response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-","molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were
included. Phase 2 RCTs were excluded because of their small sample sizes and inclusion of doses not further explored
in phase 3 RCTs. Summary data from intention-to-treat analyses were extracted from included reports by JSL and PAO.
The primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission. A network meta-analysis was done under the frequentist
framework, obtaining pairwise odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA)
was used to rank the included agents for each outcome. Higher SUCRA scores correlate with better efficacy, whereas
lower SUCRA scores correlate with better safety. Maintenance data on efficacy for treat-straight-through and

ABSTRACT
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked
according to their P-score.
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,","meta-analysis. Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2022.07.032

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Burr et al.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed","patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.
Induction of endoscopic improvement. On direct meta-
analysis, tofacitinib and ustekinumab, but not vedolizumab
or adalimumab, were superior to placebo for induction of
endoscopic improvement, with minimal heterogeneity

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis
Juan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet
Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed","patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.
Induction of endoscopic improvement. On direct meta-
analysis, tofacitinib and ustekinumab, but not vedolizumab
or adalimumab, were superior to placebo for induction of
endoscopic improvement, with minimal heterogeneity

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","meta-analysis. Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2022.07.032

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","353:2462–2476.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","353:2462–2476.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Burr et al.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs

• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed

• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","1.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Burr et al.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","1.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

to the newer IBD drugs. This is the case for ustekinumab and less
frequently for vedolizumab (Phillips et al., 2020; Ben Abdallah et al.,
2021). Uveitis also appears to respond to anti-TNF agents (Leal et al.,
2019), whereas no biological agents, despite high expectations for
vedolizumab, has shown efﬁcacy in primary sclerosing cholangitis
(Christensen et al., 2018; Lynch et al., 2020).
Fistula development affects up to 50% of CD patients over 20 years of
disease course. Half of these patients experience perianal ﬁstula (Rub-
bino et al., 2021). After surgical drainage of pelvic sepsis, medical ther-
apy may be undertaken. Best results so far are obtained with anti-TNF
agents. Among them, only inﬂiximab has been evaluated in a large,
dedicated placebo-randomized trial. Out of 366 patients who received

Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis in the USA. Another

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis in the USA. Another
meta-analysis showed that sphingosine 1-phosphate
modulators are associated with an increased risk of herpes
zoster infection and transient cardiovascular events.45
Our study has several limitations besides the usual
limitations of network meta-analyses. First, data from
some clinical trials with newer small molecule drugs were
extracted from conference abstracts, and the full data could
not be completely analysed. Notably, we could only analyse
outcomes for the overall population as the main analysis,
and not according to previous exposure to biologics. We
did do an exploratory analysis according to previous
biologic exposure, but data for upadacitinib could not be
included. Second, no phase 3 RCTs with etrasimod or

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","network

We conducted 2 separate pairwise and network
meta-analyses of induction therapy to estimate the
comparative efﬁcacy of different agents in biologic-
naïve patients and in patients with prior exposure to
TNFa antagonists for management of moderate–severe
ulcerative
colitis.
Studies
included
in
these
meta-
analyses were phase II or III randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,
with a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)
comparator: another active intervention or placebo;","multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis in the USA. Another
meta-analysis showed that sphingosine 1-phosphate
modulators are associated with an increased risk of herpes
zoster infection and transient cardiovascular events.45
Our study has several limitations besides the usual
limitations of network meta-analyses. First, data from
some clinical trials with newer small molecule drugs were
extracted from conference abstracts, and the full data could
not be completely analysed. Notably, we could only analyse
outcomes for the overall population as the main analysis,
and not according to previous exposure to biologics. We
did do an exploratory analysis according to previous
biologic exposure, but data for upadacitinib could not be
included. Second, no phase 3 RCTs with etrasimod or
TD-1473 were found; results from phase 3 clinical trials
testing novel small molecule drugs (eg, etrasimod) in
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis are","prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares
and

immunosuppressive
therapies and corticosteroids, and impose a signiﬁcant
direct and indirect economic burden in population-

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","(P A Olivera); Gastroenterology

","Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking","†Medicus Economics LLC, Milton, Massachusetts, USA

There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate
response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-","patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,",23,0.1

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.
Induction of endoscopic improvement. On direct meta-
analysis, tofacitinib and ustekinumab, but not vedolizumab
or adalimumab, were superior to placebo for induction of
endoscopic improvement, with minimal heterogeneity

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.",23,0.8

with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either

(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,

There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across

logic-naïve patients with moderate–severe ulcerative
colitis, treated with inﬂiximab (4 trials, 667 patients),
adalimumab (4 trials, 1046 patients), golimumab (2 tri-

direct
meta-
analysis, all agents were superior to placebo for induc-
tion of clinical remission, and effect size was strongest
for inﬂiximab (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.68–6.16) and vedoli-
zumab (OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.53–6.26), with minimal to","tagonists. Overall, tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.91) and ustekinu-

in
patients
with
moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with prior exposure to

endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated

with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,

ieve induction of endoscopic improvement.
Second-line
pharmacotherapy
for
moderate–severe
ulcerative colitis. Overall, 7 RCTs including 1580 pa-
tients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with prior
exposure to TNFa antagonists were identiﬁed. These
included subgroup analyses of trials of adalimumab,21
vedolizumab,24,25
tofacitinib,26
and
ustekinumab.7
There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate
response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Articles

and parenteral adminis tration.4 Drug development has
shifted in the past decade to small molecule drugs in an
effort to overcome these limitations. Tofacitinib, a Janus
kinase (JAK) inhibitor, was the first next-generation
small molecule drug to receive approval from the US
Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.5
Ozanimod became the second small molecule drug to
receive approval. Other compounds, including filgotinib
and upadacitinib, have been efficacious for the treatment
of ulcerative colitis in phase 3 randomised clinical trials
(RCTs)6–8 and will probably become available in the clinic
in the near future. With a growing therapeutic
armamentarium, and a paucity of direct comparisons,
drug positioning is a clinical challenge. Several network

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel",25,0

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel",25,0.3

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel",25,0.6

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel",25,0.8

The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-

Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Burr et al.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","TD-1473 were found; results from phase 3 clinical trials
testing novel small molecule drugs (eg, etrasimod) in
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis are
expected soon, which will warrant further updates
of this analysis. Additionally, several newer biologics,
especially anti-IL-23 drugs (ie, risankizumab, mirikizumab,
guselkumab, and brazikumab), are also expected to yield
positive results in phase 3 clinical trials, so these data
should also be considered in the future to determine
their position in treatment algorithms. Third, thorough",26,0.1

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Burr et al.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","TD-1473 were found; results from phase 3 clinical trials
testing novel small molecule drugs (eg, etrasimod) in
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis are
expected soon, which will warrant further updates
of this analysis. Additionally, several newer biologics,
especially anti-IL-23 drugs (ie, risankizumab, mirikizumab,
guselkumab, and brazikumab), are also expected to yield
positive results in phase 3 clinical trials, so these data
should also be considered in the future to determine
their position in treatment algorithms. Third, thorough",26,0.4

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","TD-1473 were found; results from phase 3 clinical trials
testing novel small molecule drugs (eg, etrasimod) in
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis are
expected soon, which will warrant further updates
of this analysis. Additionally, several newer biologics,
especially anti-IL-23 drugs (ie, risankizumab, mirikizumab,
guselkumab, and brazikumab), are also expected to yield
positive results in phase 3 clinical trials, so these data
should also be considered in the future to determine
their position in treatment algorithms. Third, thorough",26,0.7

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","antagonist

Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,",27,0

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially

economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and

colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of

and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,",27,0.5

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:","ulcerative
colitis,
appropriately
comparing trials of maintenance therapy with different
designs, adding the GRADE framework and assessment
of absolute effect size, and performing a thorough
quantitative and qualitative assessment of the safety of
different therapies, we have been able to contextualize

comparisons, and more thoroughly inform positioning of

there is a paucity of head-to-head trials to truly inform
comparative efﬁcacy and safety. However, it is important
to note that across trials of induction therapy, key
inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome deﬁnitions, and
patient and clinical characteristics, co-interventions were
comparable across trials, which facilitated this network
meta-analysis.

Management of Moderate–Severe UC 2181","Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking","hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers","perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107

Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global",28,0

","micronutrients in diet, as well as food additives, processing,
and packaging.104 Currently, there is no recommendation
for whole foods–based management of IBD, but future
studies will delineate this further.
Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107
Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after
weighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC","prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares
and
hospitalizations
requiring
immunosuppressive
therapies and corticosteroids, and impose a signiﬁcant
direct and indirect economic burden in population-
based cohorts.2,3 Several treatment options now are

Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global",28,0.3

","micronutrients in diet, as well as food additives, processing,
and packaging.104 Currently, there is no recommendation
for whole foods–based management of IBD, but future
studies will delineate this further.
Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107
Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after
weighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC","prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares
and
hospitalizations
requiring
immunosuppressive
therapies and corticosteroids, and impose a signiﬁcant
direct and indirect economic burden in population-
based cohorts.2,3 Several treatment options now are

ﬁles, and positioning different agents in the treatment

Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global",28,0.6

","micronutrients in diet, as well as food additives, processing,
and packaging.104 Currently, there is no recommendation
for whole foods–based management of IBD, but future
studies will delineate this further.
Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107
Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after
weighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC","prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares
and
hospitalizations
requiring
immunosuppressive
therapies and corticosteroids, and impose a signiﬁcant
direct and indirect economic burden in population-
based cohorts.2,3 Several treatment options now are

ulcerative colitis, with variable efﬁcacy and safety pro-
ﬁles, and positioning different agents in the treatment

Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","network

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","network

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","network

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1

third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","Table 1. Trial and Patient Characteristics in Included Trials of Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Moderate–Severe Ulcerative Colitis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","Tsapas A. Systematic review with network meta-analysis: the impact

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.
