[{"question": "40 year old male with newly diagnosed moderate UC and articular extraintestinal manifestations\n", "answer": "Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Adalimumab and Golimumab. \n\n1. Adalimumab (ADA)\n   - Advantages: Adalimumab has been evaluated in UC and has shown efficacy. It is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for some patients. It has also been shown to be superior to Vedolizumab (VDZ) in some evaluations.\n   - Disadvantages: The patient may experience side effects from Adalimumab, and the frequency of administration (weekly) may be inconvenient for some patients.\n\n2. Golimumab (GOL)\n   - Advantages: Golimumab has also been evaluated in UC and has shown efficacy. It is also administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for some patients. \n   - Disadvantages: The patient may experience side effects from Golimumab. The dosage and frequency of administration may need to be adjusted based on the patient's response and tolerance.\n\nIt's important to note that while these drugs have shown efficacy in treating UC, the patient's response may vary. Regular monitoring and follow-up are necessary to assess the patient's response and adjust the treatment plan as needed. \n\n[{\"drug_name\": \"Adalimumab\", \"advantages\": \"Evaluated in UC, shown

his colitis is worsening despite compliance. This suggests a failure to respond to Infliximab.\n\nGiven this, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Ustekinumab and Golimumab.\n\n1. Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has shown efficacy in improving the quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis. It has a different mechanism of action than Infliximab, which may be beneficial in a patient who has not responded to Infliximab.\n   - Disadvantages: The efficacy of Ustekinumab is lower than that of Infliximab (2.5 vs 5 mg/kg Q8W1.2). This means that it may not be as effective in controlling the disease.\n\n2. Golimumab:\n   - Advantages: Like Ustekinumab, Golimumab has also shown to improve the quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis. It is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for some patients.\n   - Disadvantages: The efficacy of Golimumab in ulcerative colitis has not been explicitly stated in the context provided.

Infliximab:\n   - Advantages: Infliximab is known for its efficacy in inducing clinical remission and is ranked highest for all endpoints in all patients. It is also superior to placebo and is most efficacious for induction of remission when used with or without immunomodulators. It targets the tumour necrosis factor, which is beneficial in treating ulcerative colitis.\n   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is significantly inferior to golimumab, filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, and adalimumab. This means that these drugs may provide better results in some patients.\n\n2. Adalimumab:\n   - Advantages: Adalimumab has been shown to improve the quality of life in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It also has a good response rate, with 33.5% of patients responding to a dosage of 40 mg Q2Wf1.4.\n   - Disadvantages: The use of Adalimumab carries a risk of infections. It is also significantly inferior to Infliximab, which means that Infliximab may provide better results in some patients.\n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential side effects of the drugs.
