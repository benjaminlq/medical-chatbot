Vedolizumab has also been shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.\n  - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may not be as effective in patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy in the past. Additionally, potential side effects of vedolizumab include headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever.\n\n- Ustekinumab:\n  - Advantages: Ustekinumab is an immunosuppressant that blocks interleukin-12 and -23, cytokines involved in inflammatory and immune responses. It has been shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, and it is also used to treat certain autoimmune conditions, which could be beneficial for this patient with optic neuritis.\n  - Disadvantages: Potential side effects of ustekinumab include upper respiratory infection, headache, and fatigue. There is also a risk of serious infections, and the drug may not be as effective in patients who have previously failed anti-TNF therapy.\n\nPlease note that these are general advantages and disadvantages, and the suitability of these drugs for this patient would also depend on other factors such as her overall health, other medications she is taking, and her personal preferences.\n\n[ {\"drug_name\": \"Vedolizumab\", \"advantages\": \"Gut-selective immunosuppressant, shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis\", \"disadvantages\": \"May not be as effective in patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy, potential side effects include headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever\"}, {\"drug_name\": \"Ustekinumab\", \"advantages\": \"Blocks interleukin-12 and -23, shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, also used to treat certain autoimmune conditions\", \"disadvantages\": \"Potential side effects include upper respiratory infection, headache, and fatigue, risk of serious infections, may not be as effective in patients who have previously failed anti-TNF therapy\"} ]", "sources": [{"title": "Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf", "page": 0, "text": "third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an \nimpaired health-related quality of life and considerable \neconomic burden.2,3\nNearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis \nfactor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and \ngolimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative \ncolitis, enabling better disease control in terms of \nincreasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, \nand corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality"}, {"title": "First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis", "filename": "PIIS1542356520300446.pdf", "page": 1, "text": "trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:\n(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to\nsevere ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6\u201312,\nwith an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were\neither\ntreatment-na\u00efve\n(\ufb01rst-line)\nor\npreviously\nexposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-\nvention: biologic therapy with in\ufb02iximab, adalimumab,\ngolimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,\nwith a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)"}, {"title": "First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis", "filename": "PIIS1542356520300446.pdf", "page": 0, "text": "course with signi\ufb01cant morbidity, with frequent \ufb02ares\nand\nhospitalizations\nrequiring\nimmunosuppressive\ntherapies and corticosteroids, and impose a signi\ufb01cant\ndirect and indirect economic burden in population-\nbased cohorts.2,3 Several treatment options now are\navailable\nfor\nthe\nmanagement\nof\nmoderate\u2013severe\nulcerative colitis, with variable ef\ufb01cacy and safety pro-\n\ufb01les, and positioning different agents in the treatment\ncourse as \ufb01rst-line (in biologic-na\u00efve patients) and"}, {"title": "Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf", "page": 8, "text": "moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review \nand network meta-analysis.
