However, their use in patients with cardiac conditions requires careful consideration due to potential side effects and interactions. \n\nAzathioprine:\n\nPros:\n1. Azathioprine is an oral medication, which may be more convenient for some patients.\n2. It has been used for many years in the treatment of UC, so its effects and side effects are well-known.\n3. It can be effective in maintaining remission in UC.\n\nCons:\n1. Azathioprine can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, which can be problematic in patients with cardiac conditions.\n2. It may increase the risk of infections, which can be particularly dangerous in patients with cardiac conditions.\n3. There is a potential risk of malignancy with long-term use of azathioprine.\n\nInfliximab:\n\nPros:\n1. Infliximab is a biologic agent that targets a specific part of the immune system, potentially offering more targeted treatment.\n2. It can be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in UC.\n\nCons:\n1. Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may be less convenient for some patients.\n2. It can cause serious infections, including tuberculosis and fungal infections, which can be particularly dangerous in patients with cardiac conditions.\n3. There have been reports of heart failure in patients treated with infliximab, so it may not be suitable for patients with certain cardiac conditions.\n4. Infliximab can cause infusion reactions, which can be serious.\n\nIn conclusion, both azathioprine and infliximab have potential benefits and risks in the treatment of moderate UC in patients with cardiac conditions. The choice of treatment should be individualized, taking into account the patient's overall health, the severity of their UC, their cardiac condition, and their personal preferences.\n\nFinal Answer: Based on the patient's profile and the information gathered, the top two choices of biological drugs for her moderate UC could be Azathioprine and Infliximab. \n\nAzathioprine Pros: It is an oral medication, has been used for many years in the treatment of UC, and can be effective in maintaining remission.
