Phase 3, placebo-\ncontrolled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small \nmolecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were"}, {"title": "Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis", "filename": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf", "page": 1, "text": "Burr et al. \n \n1 of 45 \nAccepted 2nd December 2021 \nTITLE PAGE \n \nTitle: Efficacy of Biological Therapies and Small Molecules in Moderate to Severe \nUlcerative Colitis: Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis. \n \nShort title: Network Meta-analysis of Biological Therapies and Small Molecules for UC. \n \nAuthors: Nicholas E.
