Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient has moderate ulcerative colitis and has been previously exposed to infliximab but is not responding well to the treatment. Here are two top choices of biological drugs for this patient:

1. Ustekinumab:

Advantages: Ustekinumab is highly effective for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with prior exposure to anti-TNF agents like infliximab. It's a good option for patients with substantial comorbidities or contraindications to TNF antagonists.

Disadvantages: Some patients may have an allergic reaction to ustekinumab. There's also a risk of infection and it may not work for everyone. It's administered subcutaneously which may not be convenient for some patients.

2. Tofacitinib:

Advantages: Tofacitinib, an oral medication, has been shown to be effective in patients with prior exposure to anti-TNF-α therapies. It's ranked highly for inducing clinical remission and endoscopic improvement.

Disadvantages: While tofacitinib is generally well-tolerated, potential side effects can include serious infections, increased cholesterol levels, increased risk of heart problems, and risk of blood clots.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

preferential janus kinase-1 inhibitor, although given filgotinib also has increased selectivity
for janus kinase-1 this cannot be the sole reason for upadacitinib’s higher ranking. Despite
these limitations, the results of our study are still useful for informing treatment decisions for
patients with moderate to severely active UC and can be used in future updates of evidence-
based management guidelines.
An initial network meta-analyses by Singh et al. demonstrated infliximab to be the
most efficacious drug for patients naïve to biological therapies in terms of induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, with vedolizumab ranked second.[22] In
patients exposed to biological therapies tofacitinib ranked first for both clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. An update to this work from 2020, including data from head-to-
head trials of vedolizumab and adalimumab, as well as phase III placebo-controlled trials of
ustekinumab, demonstrated again that infliximab was ranked first for induction of clinical
remission and endoscopic improvement in biologic-naïve patients, with ustekinumab and
tofacitinib ranked highest in patients previously exposed to biologics.[23] This later network
meta-analysis included 14 induction of remission trials, recruiting almost 5500 patients,
although the Japanese trial of infliximab versus placebo in 208 patients reported by
Kobayashi et al. was not included.[42] In contrast to these previous network meta-analyses,
our results provide hope that some novel drugs, which are likely to come to market soon, are
potentially more efficacious for moderate to severely active UC than existing licensed
therapies.
Our results confirm that all available drugs, other than adalimumab 160/160mg,
adalimumab 80/40mg, and filgotinib 100mg o.d. were more efficacious than placebo for the
treatment of moderate to severe UC, across all endpoints studied at 6 to 14 weeks. All drugs
were safe and well-tolerated, with no significant increase in serious adverse events or adverse

We included phase 3 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria:
(1) studies including adult (≥18 years) patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (defined as a Mayo
Score of 6–12, with an endoscopic sub-score of 2–3) who
were either biologic-naive or had previously been exposed
to at least one biologic; (2) studies either evaluating the
following biologics and small molecule drugs in their
approved dose regimens, infliximab (intravenous or
subcutaneous), adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab
(intravenous or sub cutaneous), ustekinumab (intravenous
or subcutaneous), tofacitinib, or ozanimod, or studies
evaluating etroli zumab, upadacitinib, filgotinib, etrasimod,
or TD-1473; (3) studies including an active comparator or
placebo; and (4) studies assessing the following outcomes:
clinical remission (defined as a Mayo score of ≤2, with no
individual sub-score >1) and endoscopic improvement
(Mayo endoscopic sub-score 0–1). We did not include
phase 2 trials because treatment effects can be over-
estimated or underestimated due to the intrinsically small
sample sizes of these studies. Additionally, given the dose-
ranging nature of phase 2 trials, many of them include
doses that will not be further explored in phase 3 trials.
For approved agents, only approved doses were

Advantages:
- UST targets the p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, cytokines involved in inflammatory and immune responses, thus effectively managing both UC and psoriasis.
- It has been observed to have good safety profile with no increased risk of serious infections compared to placebo.

Disadvantages:
- UST requires subcutaneous administration which may not be convenient for all patients.
- It may take several weeks to start seeing improvements in symptoms.

Infliximab:
Infliximab is a potent anti-TNF agent that is proven to be effective in treating UC.

Advantages:
- Infliximab is a well-established treatment for UC with a high degree of efficacy and a known safety profile.
- It is administered intravenously, which may be more convenient for some patients compared to subcutaneous injections.

Disadvantages:
- Infliximab might not be as effective in treating psoriasis as it is in treating UC.
- Some patients might develop resistance to infliximab over time, reducing its efficacy.
- There is a risk of developing infections and other side effects.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Efficacy and Safety of Advanced Therapies
incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the
Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which
tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are
currently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-
verely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-
tolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi’s.4–7 All orally
administered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their
JAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and
UPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1
over JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-
erentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-
tional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs
of JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-
tively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P),
is also approved for use in UC.10
With this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid
toward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of
development for moderately to severely active UC. Most
recently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and
published a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist
network meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely
UC. Both studies assessed all outcomes after induction (6–14
weeks); Lasa et al11 additionally assessed efficacy after main-
tenance (26–66 weeks) separately for treat-through (TT) and","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

In the last 10 years small molecules, which can be administered orally and on a daily
basis, have also been evaluated in moderate to severe UC. These include janus kinase
inhibitors, such as tofacitinib,[20] and the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator,
ozanimod.[21] The comparative efficacy and safety of all these drugs has been assessed in
prior network meta-analyses.[22, 23] These demonstrated that infliximab was ranked highest
overall for efficacy, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
previous anti-TNF-α exposure. However, this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already
several newer drugs that have shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not
considered in these network meta-analyses.[24-26] We have therefore performed an updated
network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of all biological therapies and small molecules
that have progressed on to phase III trials, compared with each other or with placebo, in terms
of induction of remission, endoscopic improvement, and clinical response, as well as safety,
in patients with moderate to severely active UC.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo, although etrolizumab 105mg was more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than golimumab 200/100mg, ustekinumab 6mg/kg,
vedolizumab 300mg, and infliximab 5mg/kg. Vedolizumab 300mg was the least likely drug
to lead to infections. Infections were significantly more likely with tofacitinib 10mg b.i.d.
than with either placebo or vedolizumab 300mg. Finally, withdrawals due to adverse events
were significantly less likely with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. than with placebo. Upadacitinib
45mg o.d. was significantly less likely to lead to withdrawals due to an adverse event than
infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg, vedolizumab 300mg, adalimumab 160/80mg or 80/40mg,
filgotinib 200mg o.d., and etrolizumab 105mg. Applying GRADE criteria to our estimates of
effects, certainty in the quality of evidence would be high.
There are some limitations. Only nine of 27 trials were at low risk of bias across all
domains. Given the timespan of included studies, there is the possibility that trials of newer
drugs included patients with refractory UC who had failed multiple other therapies. However,
some of these more recent trials only recruited patients who were naïve to anti-TNF-α","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and
waning, but the underlying systemic inﬂammation can lead
to progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinal
damage

adequately.15
Complications
associated
with
ongoing
inﬂammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, ﬁstulas,
abscesses, and surgery,3,16 and those associated with UC
include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and
colorectal cancer.2,4,17 Other complications include anemia,
nutritional deﬁciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-
sive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inﬂamma-
tion

associated
with

risking
permanent loss of height.18 Similar to other chronic dis-
eases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-
tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be
measured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.19
Limited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,
Symptoms, and Complications
The concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and
symptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a
population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-
mation may precede formal diagnosis.22 The STRIDE

ease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant to

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.
We refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the
American College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn’s and
Colitis
Organization,
and
British
Society

Gastro-
enterology.37–40
Risk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication
at Diagnosis
Appropriately
risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient."

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

interventions were observed when assessing adverse events and serious adverse events. Vedolizumab ranked lowest

adverse events (0·843) and ozanimod ranked highest for serious adverse events (0·831).
Interpretation Upadacitinib was the best performing agent for the induction of clinical remission (the primary
outcome) but the worst performing agent in terms of adverse events in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,
namely vedolizumab and, more recently, usteki numab.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

“safety” OR “adverse events”]. Additionally, experts in the
field were contacted for any unpublished data.
We included phase 3 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria:
(1) studies including adult (≥18 years) patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (defined as a Mayo
Score of 6–12, with an endoscopic sub-score of 2–3) who
were either biologic-naive or had previously been exposed
to at least one biologic; (2) studies either evaluating the
following biologics and small molecule drugs in their
approved dose regimens, infliximab (intravenous or
subcutaneous), adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab
(intravenous or sub cutaneous), ustekinumab (intravenous
or subcutaneous), tofacitinib, or ozanimod, or studies
evaluating etroli zumab, upadacitinib, filgotinib, etrasimod,
or TD-1473; (3) studies including an active comparator or
placebo; and (4) studies assessing the following outcomes:
clinical remission (defined as a Mayo score of ≤2, with no
individual sub-score >1) and endoscopic improvement
(Mayo endoscopic sub-score 0–1). We did not include
phase 2 trials because treatment effects can be over-
estimated or underestimated due to the intrinsically small
sample sizes of these studies. Additionally, given the dose-
ranging nature of phase 2 trials, many of them include
doses that will not be further explored in phase 3 trials.
For approved agents, only approved doses were
included in our analyses (intravenous infliximab:
5 mg/kg in weeks 0, 2, and 6 in induction, and 5 mg/kg
every 8 weeks in maintenance; subcutaneous infliximab:
120 mg every 2 weeks in maintenance; subcutaneous
adalimumab: 160 mg in week 0, 80 mg in week 2, and
40 mg in week 4 in induction, and 40 mg every other
week in maintenance; subcutaneous golimumab: 200 mg
in week 0 and 100 mg in week 2 in induction, and 100 mg
every 4 weeks in maintenance; intravenous vedolizumab:
300 mg in weeks 0, 2, and 6 in induction, and
300 mg every 8 weeks in maintenance; subcutaneous
vedolizumab: 108 mg every 2 weeks in maintenance;
ustekinumab: 6 mg/kg intravenously in week 0 in
induction, and 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks in
maintenance; oral tofacitinib: 10 mg twice daily for
8 weeks in induction, and 5 mg twice daily in
maintenance; and oral ozanimod: 1 mg daily in induction

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile of losing response to Infliximab due to antibody formation, the top two choices for biological drugs would be Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab.

1. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has demonstrated efficacy in patients with previous exposure to TNF antagonists, making it a suitable choice for this patient. It also has a good safety profile with lower odds of discontinuation due to adverse events during maintenance.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab might take longer to show improvements compared to other treatments. It is administered subcutaneously, which might be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is also effective in patients who have had prior exposure to TNF antagonists. It targets α or β integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, providing a different mechanism of action.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab might not be as effective as other therapies in inducing remission. It is administered intravenously, which could be inconvenient for some patients.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

the use of vedolizumab (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.87–4.25) over
placebo, for induction of clinical remission in patients with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Table 3). On com-
parison of active interventions, there was moderate con-
ﬁdence in estimates supporting the use of tofacitinib and
ustekinumab over adalimumab (tofacitinib vs adalimu-
mab: OR, 11.05; 95% CI, 1.79–68.41; ustekinumab vs
adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20), and over
vedolizumab (tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95%
CI, 1.00–38.00; ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76) for induction of clinical remission in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists. Overall,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87)
were ranked highest for inducing clinical remission in
patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.

text: non response to an anti-TNF was found to be a predictor for diminished
treatment efﬁcacy with an anti-integrin biologic (Singh et al., 2018c).
First and second line agent treatment sequences and treatment response
have been presented in the previous chapter. However, data are even
scarcer concerning third line of treatment after two anti-TNFs exposure.
A retrospective small series of 67 patients with Crohn's disease treated
with 3rd line anti-TNF agent (Allez et al., 2010) reported a lower
response rate and the lack of late responders at 6 months. A recent
multicenter retrospective study reported the outcome of patients with
late CD who had failed treatment with one anti-TNF agent and either
vedolizumab or ustekinumab. After 48 weeks on a third line of biologic
therapy the remission rate was 30.7% whereas the surgery rate was
23.5% (Kassouri et al., 2020).
There is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD
patients. During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to re-
sponders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R,
and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T
cells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests
that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor
agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019)
when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have
occurred.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked
according to their P-score.
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,
P-score 0.98), with infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg second and third, respectively.
Upadacitinib ranked first for clinical remission in both patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs
(RR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.61-0.78, P-score 0.99) and previously exposed (RR = 0.78; 95% CI
0.72-0.85, P-score 0.99). Upadacitinib was superior to almost all other drugs in these
analyses. Based on failure to achieve endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked
first (RR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.51-0.72, P-score 0.97), with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. second, and
infliximab 5mg/kg third. Upadacitinib was more likely to lead to adverse events, but serious
adverse events were no more frequent, and withdrawals due to adverse events were
significantly lower than with placebo. Infections were significantly more likely with
tofacitinib than placebo (RR = 1.41; 95% CI 1.03-1.91).
Conclusion: In a network meta-analysis, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first for clinical
remission in all patients, patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs, and patients previously exposed."

Human: question","Based on the given patient profile, the patient has moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Given her conditions, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Adalimumab.

Infliximab and Adalimumab are both TNF inhibitors, which can be effective for both ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis.

1. Infliximab
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also effective for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Infliximab is administered intravenously, which allows for monitored administration.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects such as increased risk of infections. It can cause infusion-related reactions and there is a risk of developing antibodies to infliximab which can reduce its effectiveness.

2. Adalimumab
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is also used for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis when other treatments have failed. It is also indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike Infliximab, it is administered via subcutaneous injection, which could be more convenient for some patients.
   - Disadvantages: Side effects can include increased risk of infections. It may not be as effective as other biologics in some patients.

Please note that the choice of therapy should be individualized and discussed with the patient, taking into account the potential benefits and risks, as well as patient preferences.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were"

- Whether treated patient is new patient or patient under maintenance
- Prior response to Infliximab
- Prior failure to Anti-TNF agents
- Prior failure to Vedolizumab
- Age

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is not new and under maintenance. The age of the patient is also considered. However, there is not enough information about the patient's prior response to Infliximab, Anti-TNF agents, Vedolizumab, pregnancy status, extraintestinale manifestations and pouchitis.

Without this information, it's hard to provide the top 2 choices for biological drugs treatment. However, given the age and preference for limited hospital visits, the drugs that may be suitable are ones that can be administered orally or through self-injection.

It's important for the patient to discuss these options with their healthcare provider to make an informed decision.",,,,,,,"title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

Risk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication

Appropriately
risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

implicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared

higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

mab: OR, 11.05; 95% CI, 1.79–68.41; ustekinumab vs

patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists. Overall,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87)
were ranked highest for inducing clinical remission in
patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.

Human: question","Based on the provided patient profile, the top two choices for biological drugs could be:

1. Infliximab
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can also be beneficial for patients with extraintestinal manifestations like spondyloarthritis.
   - Disadvantages: Potential side effects include risk of infections, infusion reactions, and possible development of antibodies against the drug which can decrease its effectiveness.

2. Ustekinumab
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab can be a good choice for patients with spondyloarthritis and it has shown efficacy in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered subcutaneously and may be preferred if the patient is averse to intravenous infusions.
   - Disadvantages: Potential side effects can include infection risk. Its efficacy in ulcerative colitis is less established compared to Infliximab.

Please note that the patient's previous medical history, medication history, and personal preferences should also be considered when making a final treatment decision.",,,,,,,"title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small

Human: question","Based on the given patient profile of a 42-year-old woman with moderate ulcerative colitis who is not responding to azathioprine, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

Infliximab has been shown to be effective in achieving clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. However, it is administered intravenously which may be inconvenient for some patients. Additionally, there may be risks associated with its use, such as potential serious adverse effects including increased risk of infections.

Vedolizumab is another option, it targets α4β7 integrin and is involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has been tested and shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. However, as with Infliximab, it is also administered intravenously which may be inconvenient for some patients.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

summaries

Human: question","Given the age and condition of the patient as a new patient with moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis and low albumin levels, here are two top choices of biological drugs:

1. Infliximab: Infliximab is a TNFα antagonist and has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Advantages:
- Infliximab is a well-studied drug with established efficacy for inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.
- It may also improve quality of life by reducing hospitalization rates and the need for colectomy.

Disadvantages:
- As with all anti-TNF agents, Infliximab carries a risk of severe infections and malignancies.
- It may also cause infusion reactions and there is a possibility of developing antibodies against it, which can reduce its effectiveness.

2. Vedolizumab: Vedolizumab is an integrin receptor antagonist that is also used for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Advantages:
- Vedolizumab specifically targets the gut, potentially reducing systemic side effects.
- It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis, even in those who have failed previous treatments.

Disadvantages:
- Vedolizumab may take longer to work compared to other biologicals, which could be a disadvantage in patients with severe symptoms.
- It carries a risk of infections, especially respiratory tract infections.

Please note that the choice of therapy should be individualized and discussed with the patient, considering the benefits and risks of each option, as well as the patient's preferences and values.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on

a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of

text: perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and
waning, but the underlying systemic inﬂammation can lead
to progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinal
damage
and
risk
of
complications
if
not
treated
adequately.15
Complications
associated
with
ongoing
inﬂammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, ﬁstulas,
abscesses, and surgery,3,16 and those associated with UC
include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and
colorectal cancer.2,4,17 Other complications include anemia,
nutritional deﬁciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-
sive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inﬂamma-
tion
is
associated
with
growth
impairment,
risking
permanent loss of height.18 Similar to other chronic dis-
eases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-
tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be
measured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.19
Limited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,
Symptoms, and Complications
The concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and
symptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a
population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-
mation may precede formal diagnosis.22 The STRIDE

ease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant to

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were"

Human: question","Based on the patient profile (moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, prior failure to Tofacitinib, and age), the top two choices of biological drugs could be:

1) Ustekinumab
2) Vedolizumab

Explanation:
Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab have been shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who have had prior exposure to anti-TNF agents.

Ustekinumab:
Advantages: Ustekinumab is an effective treatment for patients with anti-TNF failure. It is also a preferred choice for patients with substantial comorbidities or contraindications to TNF antagonists.
Disadvantages: Possible side effects may include respiratory infections, headache, and fatigue. It may also not be as effective in some patients.

Vedolizumab:
Advantages: Vedolizumab is also effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe UC, particularly for those who have had prior exposure to anti-TNF agents. It is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which may limit systemic side effects.
Disadvantages: Common side effects may include headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever. Some patients may not respond to treatment, and there is a risk of serious infections.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized and take into consideration the patient's specific needs, preferences, and possible comorbidities.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked
according to their P-score.
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,
P-score 0.98), with infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg second and third, respectively.
Upadacitinib ranked first for clinical remission in both patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs
(RR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.61-0.78, P-score 0.99) and previously exposed (RR = 0.78; 95% CI
0.72-0.85, P-score 0.99). Upadacitinib was superior to almost all other drugs in these
analyses. Based on failure to achieve endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked
first (RR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.51-0.72, P-score 0.97), with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. second, and
infliximab 5mg/kg third. Upadacitinib was more likely to lead to adverse events, but serious
adverse events were no more frequent, and withdrawals due to adverse events were
significantly lower than with placebo. Infections were significantly more likely with
tofacitinib than placebo (RR = 1.41; 95% CI 1.03-1.91).
Conclusion: In a network meta-analysis, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first for clinical
remission in all patients, patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs, and patients previously exposed.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate
response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-

ﬁdence in estimates supporting the use of tofacitinib and
ustekinumab over adalimumab (tofacitinib vs adalimu-

patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists. Overall,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87)
were ranked highest for inducing clinical remission in
patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
