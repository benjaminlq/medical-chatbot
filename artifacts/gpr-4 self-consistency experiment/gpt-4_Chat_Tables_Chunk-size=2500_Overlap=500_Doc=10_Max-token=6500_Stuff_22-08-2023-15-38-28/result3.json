Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

However, treatment limitations for \nmoderately to severely active UC remain, including primary \nnonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and \nparenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, \nthere has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs \n(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-\nnogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the \nJanus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which \ntofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are \ncurrently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-\nverely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-\ntolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally \nadministered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their \nJAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and \nUPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 \nover JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-\nerentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-\ntional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs \nof JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-\ntively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), \nis also approved for use in UC.10\nWith this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid \ntoward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of \ndevelopment for moderately to severely active UC.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by \nadjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.\nResults:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included.

For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or \nserious infections across therapies.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued."}, {"title": "", "filename": "otad009.pdf", "page": 0, "text": "laise, weight loss, and fever.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

A useful adjunct\nto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool\nmarker of in\ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC \ufffd 40 mg/\ng carried a \ufffd1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index \ufffd8 and/\nor FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to\n100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional\nimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.\nWe refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn\u2019s and\nColitis\nOrganization,\nand\nBritish\nSociety\nof\nGastro-\nenterology.37\u201340\nRisk Strati\ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately\nrisk-stratifying\nprognosis\nin\npatients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection\nof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-\ngies.

Ustekinumab: As per the study by Singh et al., in patients with prior exposure to anti-TNF antagonists, ustekinumab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission. It is a viable choice for this patient who has lost response to tofacitinib. \n\nAdvantages: Ustekinumab has shown efficacy in inducing clinical remission in patients with prior exposure to anti-TNF antagonists. It targets the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, cytokines involved in the inflammatory and immune response, thus potentially reducing inflammation.\n\nDisadvantages: Potential side effects include upper respiratory infections, headache, and fatigue. Serious side effects can include infections, allergic reactions, and potentially an increased risk of certain types of cancer.\n\n2. Vedolizumab: As per Burr et al. and Singh et al., vedolizumab, an \u03b14\u03b27 integrin antagonist, could be a possible choice for patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy or other biologics.\n\nAdvantages: Vedolizumab specifically targets gut inflammation, and thus may have fewer systemic side-effects compared to other biologic therapies. It has been shown to be effective in patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy.\n\nDisadvantages: Common side effects of vedolizumab include common cold, headache, joint pain, nausea, fever, infections of the nose and throat, tiredness, cough, bronchitis, flu, back pain, rash, itching, sinus infection, throat pain, and pain in extremities. As it suppresses the immune system, there is a risk of serious infections.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"drug_name\": \"Ustekinumab\",\n    \"advantages\": \"Ustekinumab has shown efficacy in inducing clinical remission in patients with prior exposure to anti-TNF antagonists.\",\n    \"disadvantages\": \"Potential side effects include upper respiratory infections, headache, and fatigue.

Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is targeted towards the gut, which might reduce systemic side effects. It's effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. It has demonstrated efficacy even in patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy.\n   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab might take longer to work than anti-TNF agents.

Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab works by inhibiting interleukins, which are different from the tumor necrosis factor targeted by many other biologics, potentially providing an option for patients who haven't responded to or can't use anti-TNF drugs. It's also been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.\n   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab is generally reserved for patients who have failed other treatments due to its cost and the need for injection.

Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by \nadjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.\nResults:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were \nhighest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance \namong bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or \nserious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to \nAEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during \nmaintenance.\nConclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety \nacross advanced therapies.\nLay Summary \nIndirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-\nsion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across \nadvanced therapies.\nKey Words: ulcerative colitis, clinical trials, advanced therapies, network meta-analysis\nIntroduction\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-\nease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized \nby bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-\nlaise, weight loss, and fever.

Ef\ufb01cacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and\nendoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We\nperformed a \ufb01xed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated\nodds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values.
