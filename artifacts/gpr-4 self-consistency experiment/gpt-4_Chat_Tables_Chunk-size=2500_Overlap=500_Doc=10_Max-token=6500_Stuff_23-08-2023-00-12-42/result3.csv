Human: question","Given the patient profile of a 40-year-old male with newly diagnosed moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) and articular extraintestinal manifestations, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Infliximab.

1. Vedolizumab:

Advantages:
- Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, reducing the likelihood of systemic side effects.
- It has demonstrated effectiveness in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.
- It can be useful for patients with articular extraintestinal manifestations as it helps control systemic inflammation.

Disadvantages:
- The response to Vedolizumab can be slower than anti-TNF agents.
- It requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Infliximab:

Advantages:
- Infliximab has been shown to be effective in both induction and maintenance of remission in moderate to severe UC.
- It is also effective for many extraintestinal manifestations of UC, including articular manifestations.

Disadvantages:
- Infliximab has potential systemic side effects because it's not gut-selective.
- There is a risk of developing antibodies against Infliximab, which can reduce its effectiveness over time.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

and packaging.104 Currently, there is no recommendation
for whole foods–based management of IBD, but future
studies will delineate this further.
Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107
Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after
weighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC
requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for
induction and maintenance of remission, with or without
IMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-
ciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes
compared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a
monotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential
for the colon to act as a “sink” for drugs, we advocate for
checking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing
and detecting immunogenicity early along with other
pharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no
clear beneﬁt of concomitant mesalamine with biologic
therapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to
biologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe
UC
where
TNFi,
cyclosporine,
or
subtotal
colectomy
followed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good
initial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe
UC is beyond the scope of this article.
Taking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into
Consideration
EIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30%–40% of
patients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs
before IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration
across specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-
gists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to
prompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to
allow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,
but also to allow for consideration of both in the selection of","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

be related, in part, to limited access to care.54 Genes
implicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared

higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo, although etrolizumab 105mg was more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than golimumab 200/100mg, ustekinumab 6mg/kg,
vedolizumab 300mg, and infliximab 5mg/kg. Vedolizumab 300mg was the least likely drug
to lead to infections. Infections were significantly more likely with tofacitinib 10mg b.i.d.
than with either placebo or vedolizumab 300mg. Finally, withdrawals due to adverse events
were significantly less likely with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. than with placebo. Upadacitinib
45mg o.d. was significantly less likely to lead to withdrawals due to an adverse event than
infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg, vedolizumab 300mg, adalimumab 160/80mg or 80/40mg,
filgotinib 200mg o.d., and etrolizumab 105mg. Applying GRADE criteria to our estimates of
effects, certainty in the quality of evidence would be high.
There are some limitations. Only nine of 27 trials were at low risk of bias across all
domains. Given the timespan of included studies, there is the possibility that trials of newer
drugs included patients with refractory UC who had failed multiple other therapies. However,
some of these more recent trials only recruited patients who were naïve to anti-TNF-α","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

Risk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication
at Diagnosis
Appropriately
risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile (70-year-old female with newly diagnosed severe UC), I recommend the following top 2 biological drugs:

1. Infliximab
2. Vedolizumab

Here are the advantages and disadvantages of the two choices:

1. Infliximab
- Advantages: Infliximab has shown efficacy in treating moderate to severe UC in clinical trials. It targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which plays a significant role in UC.
- Disadvantages: Infliximab can have potential side effects or adverse events, including infections due to its immunosuppressive nature. It also requires intravenous administration, which may not be convenient for all patients.

2. Vedolizumab
- Advantages: Vedolizumab is another effective treatment for moderate to severe UC. It targets α4β7 integrin, reducing inflammation by blocking the migration of white blood cells to inflamed gut tissues.
- Disadvantages: Like Infliximab, Vedolizumab has potential side effects, including respiratory tract infections and headaches. It also requires intravenous administration.

Please consult with a healthcare professional before starting any medication.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo, although etrolizumab 105mg was more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than golimumab 200/100mg, ustekinumab 6mg/kg,
vedolizumab 300mg, and infliximab 5mg/kg. Vedolizumab 300mg was the least likely drug
to lead to infections. Infections were significantly more likely with tofacitinib 10mg b.i.d.
than with either placebo or vedolizumab 300mg. Finally, withdrawals due to adverse events
were significantly less likely with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. than with placebo. Upadacitinib
45mg o.d. was significantly less likely to lead to withdrawals due to an adverse event than
infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg, vedolizumab 300mg, adalimumab 160/80mg or 80/40mg,
filgotinib 200mg o.d., and etrolizumab 105mg. Applying GRADE criteria to our estimates of
effects, certainty in the quality of evidence would be high.
There are some limitations. Only nine of 27 trials were at low risk of bias across all
domains. Given the timespan of included studies, there is the possibility that trials of newer
drugs included patients with refractory UC who had failed multiple other therapies. However,
some of these more recent trials only recruited patients who were naïve to anti-TNF-α","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the

Efficacy and Safety of Advanced Therapies
incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the
Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which
tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are
currently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-
verely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-
tolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi’s.4–7 All orally
administered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their
JAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and
UPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1
over JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-
erentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-
tional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs
of JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-
tively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P),
is also approved for use in UC.10
With this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid
toward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of
development for moderately to severely active UC. Most
recently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and
published a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist
network meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely
UC. Both studies assessed all outcomes after induction (6–14
weeks); Lasa et al11 additionally assessed efficacy after main-
tenance (26–66 weeks) separately for treat-through (TT) and"

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, two potential choices of biological drugs could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it only works in the gut and minimizes systemic side effects. It may be a better choice for patients with congestive cardiac failure since it doesn't have known cardiac side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab requires intravenous administration which might not be convenient for all patients. Also, it may take several weeks to work and may not be as effective in patients with prior failure to Anti-TNF agents.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has a different mechanism of action compared with other biologic drugs, targeting interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23. It can be used in patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate other biologics. It is also administered subcutaneously, making it convenient for the patient.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may be less effective in inducing remission compared to other biologics. There could also be potential side effects including infections and allergic reactions.

Please note that the decision of treatment should be individualized considering the patient's overall health condition, lifestyle, and preference.

Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is under the age category where treatments are usually effective and safe. The patient has an extraintestinal manifestation, ankylosing spondylitis, which may affect the choice of treatment.

Given that the patient has ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis, the recommended biological drugs would be TNF-α inhibitors which have been shown to be effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis.

1. Infliximab
   Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-α inhibitor that has shown efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It works by targeting the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). For endoscopic improvement, infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first in a study.
   Disadvantages: Risks associated with infliximab include serious infections, lymphomas, and other cancers. It is administered intravenously which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Adalimumab
   Advantages: Adalimumab is another TNF-α inhibitor that has been tested for UC. It has shown efficacy in maintaining clinical response and remission in patients with Crohn's disease, which is closely related to UC. It is injected subcutaneously which some patients may find more convenient than intravenous administration.
   Disadvantages: Adalimumab also carries risks of serious infections and cancers. Some patients may not respond to the drug, and others may develop antibodies against it, reducing its effectiveness.

It is important to note that the choice of treatment should also consider the patient's preference, lifestyle, and overall health status.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, I would recommend ""Ustekinumab"" and ""Vedolizumab"".

Ustekinumab:
Advantages: It is effective in inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Ustekinumab is also less likely to induce the formation of antibodies against the drug, reducing the likelihood of loss of response over time.
Disadvantages: The drug needs to be administered via subcutaneous injection after the initial intravenous infusion, which some patients may find inconvenient or uncomfortable.

Vedolizumab:
Advantages: It is effective in inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The drug is gut-specific and does not have systemic immunosuppressive effects, which may be beneficial for this patient given her history of lymphoma.
Disadvantages: Some patients may not respond to vedolizumab, and the drug is typically reserved for those who have not responded to or cannot tolerate other treatments. The drug needs to be administered via intravenous infusion, which requires regular visits to a healthcare facility.

Please note that the final decision should be made after a thorough discussion between the patient and her healthcare provider, taking into account the patient's personal preferences, lifestyle, and overall health status.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

text: Combination therapy of a biologic with IMM, best-
studied with TNFi, is an important consideration in severe
disease, especially penetrating or perianal disease. It is
associated with improved outcomes, a decrease in loss of
TNFi response, and fewer long-term complications.90,91 The
mechanism of action may be due to decrease in immuno-
genicity and impact on drug level. Similar effects have not
been seen with adding IMM to UST of VDZ therapy, possibly
due to a lower role of immunogenicity in drug meta-
bolism.92 For patients with perianal CD, a multidisciplinary

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, she is suffering from moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) and also has multiple sclerosis. Considering her conditions, the following two biological drugs may be suitable:

1. Vedolizumab: This drug targets alpha-4 beta-7 integrin and selectively inhibits gut inflammation. It has shown efficacy in treating moderate to severe UC.

Advantages:
- Specific to gut inflammation, hence systemic immunosuppression is less likely.
- It may be a good option for patients with multiple sclerosis as it does not impact the central nervous system.

Disadvantages:
- It may take several weeks to start showing effects.
- Common side effects include headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever.
- Risk of serious infections.

2. Ustekinumab: This drug targets interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, inhibiting their activity and has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe UC.

Advantages:
- It has also been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, hence it could potentially manage both conditions.
- It can be given subcutaneously after the initial intravenous induction dose.

Disadvantages:
- Risk of serious infections.
- Other possible side effects include upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, and headache.

Please note: The choice of drug should be individualized to the patient's needs and other factors like previous treatment history, disease severity, lifestyle, and patient preference should be considered. The final decision should always be made after a detailed discussion with the patient about the potential benefits and risks.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

studies will delineate this further.
Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107
Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after
weighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC
requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for
induction and maintenance of remission, with or without
IMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-
ciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes
compared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a
monotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential
for the colon to act as a “sink” for drugs, we advocate for
checking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing
and detecting immunogenicity early along with other
pharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no
clear beneﬁt of concomitant mesalamine with biologic
therapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to
biologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe
UC
where
TNFi,
cyclosporine,
or
subtotal
colectomy
followed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good
initial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe
UC is beyond the scope of this article.
Taking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into

EIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30%–40% of
patients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis
Juan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet
Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Human: question","Since the patient has had a successful induction with Vedolizumab, the maintenance therapy would typically continue with Vedolizumab. The standard maintenance dose of Vedolizumab is 300 mg IV every 8 weeks.

Top 2 choices of biological drugs:

1. Vedolizumab
   - Advantages: This drug is specifically designed to treat inflammation in the gut, which makes it highly effective for ulcerative colitis. It has also been shown to be well-tolerated with a lower risk of serious side effects compared to some other treatments.
   - Disadvantages: It may take several weeks to start working, and it requires regular IV infusions which could be inconvenient for some patients. There is also a risk of developing antibodies against the drug, which may reduce its effectiveness.

2. Adalimumab
   - Advantages: It can be administered at home via subcutaneous injection, which may be more convenient for some patients. It has proven effectiveness in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: It may cause side effects such as infections, injection site reactions, and in rare cases, serious conditions like heart failure or nerve damage. There is also a risk of developing antibodies against the drug, which may reduce its effectiveness.

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global

Background:  Given rapid innovation in advanced therapies for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), we investigated their com-
parative efficacy and safety during induction and maintenance through network meta-analysis.
Methods:  Using Bayesian methods, endpoints of clinical remission and clinical response per Full Mayo score, and endoscopic improvement
were assessed in bio-naive and -exposed populations. Safety was assessed in overall populations by all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs,
discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Studies
included
in
these
meta-
analyses were phase II or III randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,
with a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)
comparator: another active intervention or placebo;
and (4) outcome: induction of clinical remission (Mayo
Clinic score of �2 with no individual subscore of >1)
and endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy sub-
score of 0 or 1).
Because trials of maintenance therapy of biologic
agents had different designs (treat straight-through
design vs rerandomizing responders to induction ther-
apy), we conducted separate pairwise and network
meta-analyses for these different trial designs. Because
safety is unlikely to be inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by main-
tenance therapy trial design, to inform comparative
safety, we conducted a single network meta-analysis of
all trials of maintenance therapy, regardless of different
trial design. Detailed inclusion criteria for trials of
maintenance therapy and exclusion criteria are listed in
the Supplementary Appendix.

text: comparative analysis of maintenance trials has suggested
higher safety with vedolizumab, rates of important
events such as serious infections was low and other
serious events such as malignancy could not be evalu-
ated thoroughly. Moreover, differences in study design of
maintenance therapy (treat straight-through vs reran-
domization of responders), as well as lack of information
on safety stratiﬁed by prior TNFa antagonist exposure
status, potentially may bias safety results. Postmarketing
surveillance studies of these different agents may better
inform the relative safety of these agents. Safety of
tofacitinib seems to be dose-dependent, and in instances
in which a higher 10-mg twice-per-day dose of tofacitinib
is used for long-term maintenance, safety concerns
should be discussed adequately with patients.
Integrating ﬁndings from this meta-analysis and other
studies, current evidence favors inﬂiximab or vedolizu-
mab
as
the
preferred
ﬁrst-line
agents
for
moderate–severe ulcerative colitis. In patients who fail
inﬂiximab, ustekinumab and tofacitinib likely would be
most efﬁcacious, and ustekinumab’s superior safety
proﬁle may be attractive in light of recent concerns
around
venous
thromboembolism
with
tofacitinib.
However, besides quality of evidence, several other fac-
tors including a balance of risk–beneﬁt proﬁle, speciﬁc
patient attributes (age, comorbid conditions including
rheumatic or dermatologic diseases, and so forth), clin-
ical judgment and experience of the treating physicians,
values
and
preferences
of
patients
(dosing
route,
regimen, acceptability of risk–beneﬁt trade-offs, and so
forth), as well as the costs/resources available, are
important to facilitate shared decision making, in devel-
oping a personalized treatment strategy for each patient,
and shape health care policy on positioning different
agents. Pragmatic head-to-head trials in both biologic-
naïve and biologic-exposed patients are warranted to
optimally inform the relative positioning of newly
available agents in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Human: question","Based on the patient profile, the following two biological drugs could be considered:

1. Vedolizumab

Advantages: Vedolizumab specifically targets the gut, reducing systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It's also beneficial for patients who have failed or are intolerant to anti-TNF agents.

Disadvantages: As with all biologic therapies, there are risks of severe infections and potential development of antibodies against the drug. It's also administered intravenously which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Ustekinumab

Advantages: Ustekinumab has been proven effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It's a good alternative for patients who have failed or are intolerant to anti-TNF agents and Vedolizumab.

Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may increase the risk of infections and cancer. It's also administered via injection, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

Please note that both drugs should be used with caution in patients with liver disease, as they have not been well-studied in this population.

Please consult with a healthcare provider for the best treatment options for the patient.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Inﬂammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn’s
disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic, progressive,
immune-mediated diseases of adults and children that
have no cure. IBD can cause signiﬁcant morbidity and lead
to complications such as strictures, ﬁstulas, infections, and
cancer.
In
children,
IBD
can
also
result
in
growth
impairment and pubertal delays. IBD is highly heteroge-
nous, with severity ranging from mild to severe and
symptoms ranging from mild to debilitating. Delay in IBD
diagnosis, especially in Crohn’s disease, is common and
associated with adverse outcomes. Early diagnosis and
prompt institution of treatment are the cornerstones for
improving outcomes and maximizing health. Early diag-
nosis requires a low threshold of suspicion and red ﬂags to
guide early specialist referral at the primary provider
level. Although the armamentarium of IBD medications is
growing, many patients will not respond to treatment, and
the selection of ﬁrst-line therapy is critical. Risk stratiﬁ-
cation of disease severity, based on clinical, demographic,
and serologic markers, can help guide selection of ﬁrst-line
therapy. Clinical decision support tools, genomics, and
other biomarkers of response to therapy and risk of
adverse events are the future of personalized medicine.
After starting appropriate therapy, it is important to
conﬁrm remission using objective end points (treat to
target) with continued control of inﬂammation with
adjustment of therapy using surrogate biomarkers (tight
control). Lastly, IBD therapy extends far beyond medica-
tions, and other aspects of the overall health and wellbeing
of the patient are critical. These include preventive health,
nutrition, and psychobehavioral support addressing pa-
tients’
concerns
around
complementary
therapy
and
medication
adherence,
prevention
of
disability,
and
ensuring open communication.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient has a moderate to severe form of ulcerative colitis and has been diagnosed with high-grade dysplasia 2 years ago. However, more details are needed to assess the patient's case effectively such as prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, and whether the patient is new or under maintenance.

Given the current information, two possible biological drugs to consider could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which is implicated in the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab may not work in all patients, and there may be risks associated with its use, such as increased susceptibility to infections. It is also administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab targets α or β integrins, which are involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has been shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: As with Infliximab, Vedolizumab may not work in all patients. It is also administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and
waning, but the underlying systemic inﬂammation can lead

include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and
colorectal cancer.2,4,17 Other complications include anemia,
nutritional deﬁciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-
sive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inﬂamma-

eases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-
tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be
measured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.19
Limited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,
Symptoms, and Complications
The concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and
symptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a
population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-
mation may precede formal diagnosis.22 The STRIDE

ease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant to

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.
We refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the
American College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn’s and
Colitis
Organization,
and
British
Society
of
Gastro-
enterology.37–40
Risk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication
at Diagnosis
Appropriately
risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile and preference for oral medication, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Tofacitinib and Upadacitinib.

Tofacitinib:
- Advantages: Tofacitinib is an oral medication, which would align with the patient's preference. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
- Disadvantages: Tofacitinib may have potential risks associated with its use, including increased risk of infections due to its immunosuppressive nature. It may also have potential adverse effects on lipid profiles and could potentially increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

Upadacitinib:
- Advantages: Upadacitinib, like Tofacitinib, is an oral medication and would therefore match the patient's preference. It has been shown to be particularly effective in patients who have previously been exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies. This drug has high efficacy rates based on intent-to-treat analyses.
- Disadvantages: Similar to Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib could increase the risk of infections. Its long-term safety profile is also not yet fully established.

The final decision should be made in collaboration with the patient, taking into account the potential benefits and risks of each medication.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

and packaging.104 Currently, there is no recommendation
for whole foods–based management of IBD, but future
studies will delineate this further.
Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107
Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after
weighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC
requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for
induction and maintenance of remission, with or without
IMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-
ciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes
compared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a
monotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential
for the colon to act as a “sink” for drugs, we advocate for
checking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing
and detecting immunogenicity early along with other
pharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no
clear beneﬁt of concomitant mesalamine with biologic
therapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to
biologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe
UC
where
TNFi,
cyclosporine,
or
subtotal
colectomy
followed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good
initial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe
UC is beyond the scope of this article.
Taking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into

patients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, a 41-year-old male with moderate to severe distal ulcerative colitis and alopecia areata, here are the top 2 choices of biological drugs:

1. Infliximab
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Infliximab can also aid in the healing of the intestinal lining, reducing the need for hospitalization and surgery.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects, including increased risk of infections, infusion reactions, and potential development of antibodies against the drug leading to decreased efficacy.

2. Adalimumab
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is a self-administered subcutaneous injection, which some patients may find more convenient than the intravenous infusion required for infliximab. It can also be effective in maintaining remission and promoting mucosal healing in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Adalimumab can likewise increase the risk of infections. Some patients may also experience injection site reactions.

In addition, considering the patient's alopecia areata, an autoimmune skin disease, Ustekinumab could be considered as it is effective in treating psoriasis, another autoimmune skin condition, and could potentially help with alopecia areata. However, more research is needed in this area.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Human: question","Based on the patient profile - a 38-year-old woman with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and a history of pulmonary tuberculosis treated 2 years ago - the top two choices of biological drugs could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

Vedolizumab specifically targets the gut, reducing systemic side effects, and it is less likely to reactivate latent tuberculosis compared to anti-TNF agents. However, it may be less effective than anti-TNF agents in achieving remission.

Ustekinumab targets interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, reducing inflammation in the gut. It is not associated with a high risk of tuberculosis reactivation. However, it is generally used as a second-line therapy and may be less effective in patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

timates were similar (ie, coherent), then the higher rating
can be assigned to the network meta-analysis estimates.

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.
