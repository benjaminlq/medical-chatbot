It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also less likely to reactivate latent tuberculosis due to its gut-selective action.\n   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may not be as effective in patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy.

Adalimumab:\n   - Advantages: Adalimumab is a TNF inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can be administered subcutaneously, which can be more convenient for some patients.\n   - Disadvantages: As a TNF inhibitor, Adalimumab has the potential to reactivate latent tuberculosis.
