These can\nmake the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary\ncare level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index\nconsisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage\nand identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely\nmanner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct\nto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool\nmarker of in\ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC \ufffd 40 mg/\ng carried a \ufffd1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index \ufffd8 and/\nor FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to\n100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional\nimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.\nWe refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn\u2019s and\nColitis\nOrganization,\nand\nBritish\nSociety\nof\nGastro-\nenterology.37\u201340\nRisk Strati\ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately\nrisk-stratifying\nprognosis\nin\npatients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection\nof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-\ngies.

Vedolizumab:\n- Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets inflammation in the gut and has less systemic side effects. This could be beneficial for a patient with congestive cardiac failure as it reduces the risk of exacerbating this condition. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.\n- Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to show effects compared to other biologics. It also requires intravenous administration which might not be convenient for all patients.\n\n2. Ustekinumab:\n- Advantages: Ustekinumab has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe UC. It is administered subcutaneously after the initial intravenous dose, which could be more convenient for the patient.\n- Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may have potential side effects including respiratory infections, which could be a concern in an elderly patient. It is also a relatively new drug for UC, so long-term effects are not as well known compared to other biologics.\n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health status, comorbidities, and personal preferences.

This is also a key point in the management of frail or\nmalnourished patients (Kochar et al., 2020). A pooled analysis of data\nfrom four randomized trials including 2257 UC patients reported that\nolder patients have an increased baseline risk of adverse effects not\nrelated to anti-TNF therapy. In older IBD patients, a protective effect\nagainst the development of severe adverse events have been demon-\nstrated in UC (OR 0.54 (0.35\u20130.83, p < 0.01) but not CD (OR 1.3\n(0.8\u20131.20)) when administering vedolizumab compared to anti-TNF\nagents (Cheng et al., 2021). Earlier publications, also suggested a very\ngood safety of anti-TNF agents in older populations (Bonovas et al.,\n2016). At this stage, we can thus consider all biological agents, when\nindicated, as safe in all populations.\nIn some large clinical trials, initiation of biologic therapy at a younger\nage was associated with better response, for example in\ufb02iximab in both\nCD and UC patients (Vermeire et al., 2002; Billiet et al., 2015).

However, treatment limitations for \nmoderately to severely active UC remain, including primary \nnonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and \nparenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, \nthere has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs \n(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-\nnogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the \nJanus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which \ntofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are \ncurrently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-\nverely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-\ntolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally \nadministered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their \nJAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and \nUPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 \nover JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-\nerentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-\ntional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs \nof JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-\ntively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), \nis also approved for use in UC.10\nWith this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid \ntoward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of \ndevelopment for moderately to severely active UC. Most \nrecently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and \npublished a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist \nnetwork meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely \nUC.

The patient's age and pregnancy status are important considerations in choosing a treatment. \n\nHere are two potential choices of biological drugs for this patient:\n\n1. Infliximab (Remicade)\nAdvantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can reduce inflammation and achieve remission in many patients. Infliximab has been widely studied and is generally well-tolerated.\nDisadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects including risk of infection, allergic reactions, and potential complications for the baby. It should be used with caution in pregnant women and only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n\n2. Vedolizumab (Entyvio)\nAdvantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets inflammation in the gut, potentially reducing side effects elsewhere in the body. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. \nDisadvantages: Vedolizumab is a relatively new drug, so long-term safety data is not as robust as for some other drugs. It can have side effects including risk of infection, headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever.

These can\nmake the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary\ncare level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index\nconsisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage\nand identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely\nmanner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct\nto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool\nmarker of in\ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC \ufffd 40 mg/\ng carried a \ufffd1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index \ufffd8 and/\nor FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to\n100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional\nimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.\nWe refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn\u2019s and\nColitis\nOrganization,\nand\nBritish\nSociety\nof\nGastro-\nenterology.37\u201340\nRisk Strati\ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately\nrisk-stratifying\nprognosis\nin\npatients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection\nof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-\ngies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial\npresentation can vary widely from limited and mild to\nextensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features\nare associated with a more aggressive disease course with\nhigher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk\npatients, early control of in\ufb02ammation with immune-\nmodifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-\nsive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the\nshort- and long-term, and entail signi\ufb01cant health care costs.\nTherefore, a consideration of risks, bene\ufb01ts, and alternatives\nis key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the\ninformed patient."}, {"title": "Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists", "filename": "agrawal.pdf", "page": 2, "text": "prognosis, with 1 study reporting fewer hospitalizations and\nless frequent requirement of immunosuppression in pa-\ntients diagnosed after age 60 years,47 and a meta-analysis\nsuggested\nthat,\nalthough\nelderly\nIBD\npresents\nless\ncommonly with complications, there are similar or higher\nrates of surgery compared to a nonelderly population.48 It is\nbeing increasingly recognized that frailty, rather than\nchronologic age, may be the driver of adverse outcomes in\nthis group.49,50\nOther Demographic Variables\nThere are signi\ufb01cant differences in IBD phenotype\nand outcomes based on race and ethnicity, likely due to\na multitude of factors, both social and biologic.

Ef\ufb01cacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and\nendoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We\nperformed a \ufb01xed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated\nodds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative\nranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of\nRecommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).\nRESULTS:\nIn biologic-na\u00efve patients, in\ufb02iximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR\nvs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67\u20136.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)\n(moderate con\ufb01dence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,\nustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of\nclinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;\n95% CI, 1.13\u201331.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003\u20138.00; moderate CE)\nand adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01\u201357.20 and tofacitinib"}, {"title": "Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf", "page": 2, "text": "Articles\nwww.thelancet.com/gastrohep   Vol 7   February 2022 \n163\n\u201csafety\u201d OR \u201cadverse events\u201d].

The patient's age and past medical history are important factors to consider when choosing a treatment plan. \n\nGiven her history of lymphoma, it would be advisable to avoid treatments that could potentially increase the risk of cancer recurrence. This might rule out some options such as anti-TNF agents like Infliximab and Adalimumab, which have been associated with a slight increase in the risk of lymphoma.\n\nHere are two potential choices of biological drugs for this patient:\n\n1. Vedolizumab: \n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.\n   - Disadvantages: It may take several weeks to see the effects of Vedolizumab. Side effects can include headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever. Serious side effects can include infections and liver problems.\n\n2. Ustekinumab: \n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is another option that could be considered. It is typically used for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate other medications. It works by inhibiting a specific pathway of the immune system.\n   - Disadvantages: Potential side effects include upper respiratory infections, fatigue, and headache. It's also usually considered after other treatments have failed, so it may not be a first-line option.\n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized and discussed thoroughly with the patient, taking into consideration the potential benefits and risks, as well as the patient's preferences.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"drug_name\": \"Vedolizumab\",\n    \"advantages\": \"Gut-selective immunosuppressant, less systemic side effects, effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis\",\n    \"disadvantages\": \"May take several weeks to see effects, potential side effects include headache, joint pain, nausea, fever, infections, and liver problems\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"drug_name\": \"Ustekinumab\",\n    \"advantages\": \"Can be used for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate other medications, works by inhibiting a specific pathway of the immune system\",\n    \"disadvantages\": \"Potential side effects include upper respiratory infections, fatigue, and headache, usually considered after other treatments have failed\"\n  }\n]\n```", "sources": [{"title": "Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf", "page": 8, "text": "severely active ulcerative colitis: results from phase 3 \nU-ACCOMPLISH study.

In the VARSITY trial, the only\nhead-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n \u00bc 769), VDZ was supe-\nrior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;\nP \u00bc .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P\n< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST\nmay not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-\nularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety pro\ufb01le.107\nThiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after\nweighing risks against bene\ufb01ts.64 In patients with severe UC\nrequiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for\ninduction and maintenance of remission, with or without\nIMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-\nciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes\ncompared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a\nmonotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential\nfor the colon to act as a \u201csink\u201d for drugs, we advocate for\nchecking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing\nand detecting immunogenicity early along with other\npharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no\nclear bene\ufb01t of concomitant mesalamine with biologic\ntherapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to\nbiologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe\nUC\nwhere\nTNFi,\ncyclosporine,\nor\nsubtotal\ncolectomy\nfollowed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good\ninitial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe\nUC is beyond the scope of this article.\nTaking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into\nConsideration\nEIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30%\u201340% of\npatients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs\nbefore IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration\nacross specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-\ngists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to\nprompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to\nallow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,\nbut also to allow for consideration of both in the selection of"}, {"title": "First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis", "filename": "PIIS1542356520300446.pdf", "page": 0, "text": "SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES\nSiddharth Singh, Section Editor\nFirst- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With\nModerate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated\nNetwork Meta-Analysis\nSiddharth Singh,*,\u2021 Mohammad Hassan Murad,\u00a7 Mathurin Fumery,j\nParambir S.
