Extraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and
represent an important cause of morbidity and disability (Vavricka et al.,
2011; Juillerat et al., 2020). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect
30% of patients. They include non-inﬂammatory joint pain as well as
inﬂammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as
spondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, inﬂiximab and later
the other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD
patient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials
in both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established efﬁcacies in most
rheumatological indications (Herfarth et al., 2002; Generini et al., 2004;

Vedolizumab may not represent the most appropriate biologic in
presence of articular manifestations of IBD. Indeed, by virtue of its
binding to α4β7 integrin, this antibody may not impede the entry of
proinﬂammatory cells in joints. In fact, it may even contribute to higher
inﬂux of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who
observed de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated
IBD patients (Diaz et al., 2020). An increased incidence of extra-
intestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also
been observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims
database (Dubinsky et al., 2018). However, by improving disease activity

Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, he has moderate ulcerative colitis and has been previously treated with infliximab but is not responding well as his condition is worsening. Considering his prior exposure to infliximab, a TNF antagonist, the top two choices of biological drugs would be ustekinumab and tofacitinib. 

1. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been ranked highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement. It is also ranked first for total number of adverse events, indicating a better safety profile.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of ustekinumab is the need for injection, which some patients may find inconvenient or uncomfortable. 

2. Tofacitinib:
   - Advantages: Tofacitinib has also been ranked highly in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement. It is an oral medication, which may be more convenient for some patients.
   - Disadvantages: Tofacitinib may have a higher risk of infections compared to other drugs. It also has potential side effects including headache, diarrhea, and increased cholesterol levels.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health, lifestyle, and preferences. It is also important to monitor the patient's response to the new treatment and adjust as necessary.

DISCUSSION 
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of 
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has 
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical 
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all 
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these 
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. 
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were 
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of 
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Studies had to recruit ambulatory adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severely active UC

Two investigators (NEB and ACF) conducted independent literature searches. We

inferior, but cheaper, drug should be used to treat moderate to severe UC is not the subject of 
the current study. The results of this network meta-analysis could, however, be used to 
inform a cost-effectiveness analysis to help guide future treatment selection.  
In summary, this systematic review and network meta-analysis has demonstrated that 
all biological therapies and small molecules, other than adalimumab 160/160mg, adalimumab 
80/40mg, and filgotinib 100mg o.d. were superior to placebo for induction of remission of 
moderate to severe UC, and all drugs, other than adalimumab 80/40mg, were superior to 
placebo in terms of endoscopic improvement. Among biological therapies, infliximab ranked 
highest for all endpoints in all patients, and in patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs, with 
ustekinumab ranked highest for all endpoints in patients exposed to anti-TNF-α therapy. In","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

these limitations, the results of our study are still useful for informing treatment decisions for 
patients with moderate to severely active UC and can be used in future updates of evidence-
based management guidelines.  
An initial network meta-analyses by Singh et al. demonstrated infliximab to be the 
most efficacious drug for patients naïve to biological therapies in terms of induction of 
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, with vedolizumab ranked second.[22] In 
patients exposed to biological therapies tofacitinib ranked first for both clinical remission and

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-

should be managed more proactively and aggressively. We
will review predictors of IBD severity and activity.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title:

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is not new and is under maintenance for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis. The patient's age is 56 years old. There is no information provided about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis.

Given this information, two top choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Infliximab and Adalimumab. 

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis. It can reduce inflammation and achieve remission in many patients.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects including risk of infection, allergic reactions, and potential liver damage. It is also administered via intravenous infusion which may not be convenient for all patients.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is another TNF-alpha inhibitor that can be used to treat both conditions. It is administered via subcutaneous injection which can be done at home, providing more convenience for the patient.
   - Disadvantages: Similar to Infliximab, Adalimumab can also have side effects including risk of infection, allergic reactions, and potential liver damage. Some patients may also develop resistance to the drug over time.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential side effects.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title:

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

1. Vedolizumab: 
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets the gut and does not have systemic effects. This makes it a safer option for patients with a history of malignancy like this patient. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: It may take longer to see the effects of vedolizumab compared to other biologics. It is also administered via intravenous infusion which may not be convenient for all patients.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is another biologic that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It works by inhibiting interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 which are involved in the inflammatory process of ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may increase the risk of infections. It is also administered via injection, which may not be preferred by some patients.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs."

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab. 

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Vedolizumab is that it may not be as effective in patients who have previously failed anti-TNF therapy. Additionally, it may not be suitable for patients with multiple sclerosis as it can potentially worsen neurological symptoms.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is effective in treating moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis and has a good safety profile. It is also used in the treatment of other autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and Crohn's disease.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Ustekinumab is that it requires an initial intravenous infusion, which can be inconvenient for some patients. Additionally, it may not be as effective in patients who have previously failed anti-TNF therapy.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential side effects. It is also important to consider the patient's other medical conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, when choosing a treatment.",Vedolizumab,,,Ustekinumab,,,"title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Our study has several limitations besides the usual 
limitations of network meta-analyses. First, data from 
some clinical trials with newer small molecule drugs were 
extracted from conference abstracts, and the full data could 
not be completely analysed. Notably, we could only analyse 
outcomes for the overall population as the main analysis, 
and not according to previous exposure to biologics. We 
did do an exploratory analysis according to previous 
biologic exposure, but data for upadacitinib could not be 
included. Second, no phase 3 RCTs with etrasimod or

ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Human: question","Based on the patient's successful induction with vedolizumab, the maintenance therapy would likely continue with vedolizumab. This is because vedolizumab has been shown to be effective in both the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. 

However, it's important to consider other factors such as the patient's overall health, potential side effects, and her personal preferences. 

Here are two potential options:

1. Vedolizumab
- Advantages: Vedolizumab specifically targets the gut, reducing systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
- Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is administered via intravenous infusion, which can be inconvenient. Potential side effects include headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever. In rare cases, it can cause serious infections.

2. Ustekinumab
- Advantages: Ustekinumab can be a good alternative for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate other treatments. It is administered subcutaneously and may be more convenient for some patients.
- Disadvantages: Potential side effects include upper respiratory infections, headache, and fatigue. It may also increase the risk of serious infections and cancer.

Discussion 
We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs 
of biologics and small molecule drugs (approved or in a 
late stage of development) for induction and maintenance 
treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative 
colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics, 
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than 
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and 
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study 
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of 
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and 
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other 
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab 
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety, 
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in 
terms of adverse events and serious adverse events, as 
previously 
observed","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Fifth, we analysed steroid-free remission—a more robust 
and 
clinically 
meaningful 
outcome 
than 
clinical 
remission—in maintenance trials only, as corticosteroid 
tapering was not allowed in induction trials. In addition, 
not all clinical trials reported on steroid-free remission, 
particularly the older trials. Finally, some preliminary 
reports, such as the trial of maintenance with subcutaneous 
vedolizumab, did not report relevant data for endoscopic 
improvement. 
As with any indirect comparison, the results presented 
in this study should be interpreted with caution but could 
help clinicians to navigate the current scenario in which 
the number of therapeutic options for moderate-to-
severe ulcerative colitis is steadily increasing. These 
findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating, 
until direct comparisons by means of head-to-head trials 
become available to fully elucidate the positioning of","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, he has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and has developed a loss of response to Infliximab due to antibody formation. This suggests that he has had prior exposure to anti-TNF agents (Infliximab) and has failed to respond to it. 

Given this, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be:

1. Vedolizumab
2. Ustekinumab

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: Vedolizumab is an anti-integrin antibody that has been shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. It has a different mechanism of action from anti-TNF agents, so it may be effective in patients who have failed to respond to these agents. Additionally, it has been ranked as the safest drug in terms of adverse events and serious adverse events.
- Disadvantages: The efficacy of Vedolizumab may be lower than some other agents, such as Infliximab. It may also take longer to work than anti-TNF agents.

Ustekinumab:
- Advantages: Ustekinumab is an anti-interleukin-12/23 antibody that has been shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Like Vedolizumab, it has a different mechanism of action from anti-TNF agents, so it may be effective in patients who have failed to respond to these agents.
- Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may be less effective than some other agents, such as Infliximab. There may also be a higher risk of infection with Ustekinumab compared to other agents.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, including their overall health, the severity of their disease, and their personal preferences. It's also important to consider the potential for adverse effects and drug interactions. The patient should be closely monitored while on these medications to ensure that they are effective and well-tolerated.

We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs

late stage of development) for induction and maintenance 
treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative 
colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics, 
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than 
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and 
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study 
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of 
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and 
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other 
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab 
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety, 
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is under maintenance for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The patient's age is 55 years old, and there is no information about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis. 

Given the patient's preference for convenience and limited time spent in the hospital, subcutaneous administration of medication might be more suitable. Here are two top choices of biological drugs:

1. Ustekinumab
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is administered subcutaneously, which can be done at home, reducing the need for hospital visits. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Potential side effects include respiratory infections, fatigue, headache, and skin rash. It may also increase the risk of serious infections, malignancies, and cardiovascular disorders.

2. Adalimumab
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is also administered subcutaneously, offering the same convenience as Ustekinumab. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Potential side effects include injection site reactions, upper respiratory infections, and headaches. There is also a risk of serious infections and malignancies.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized, considering the patient's disease characteristics, comorbidities, lifestyle, and preferences.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,"

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, she has severe ulcerative colitis and has lost response to anti-TNF, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab. Considering her age and prior treatment failures, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Tofacitinib and Infliximab.

1. Tofacitinib:
   - Advantages: Tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor that works differently from the drugs the patient has previously used, which may increase the chances of a positive response. It has shown efficacy in inducing remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, including those with prior exposure to TNF antagonists.
   - Disadvantages: Tofacitinib has been associated with an increased risk of infections and venous thromboembolism. It may not be the best choice for patients with comorbid conditions that increase these risks.

2. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF antagonist that has been ranked highest in biologic-naïve patients for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with moderate to severe ulceric colitis. It may still be effective in patients who have lost response to other anti-TNF agents.
   - Disadvantages: The patient has already lost response to anti-TNF agents, which may suggest that she might not respond well to Infliximab. Infliximab also carries a risk of serious infections and other side effects such as infusion reactions.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized, considering the patient's overall health status, comorbidities, and preferences. The decision should be made in consultation with the patient and her healthcare provider.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

of infections (SUCRA, 0.81), followed by ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.63) in maintenance trials.
CONCLUSIONS:
In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found inﬂiximab to be ranked highest in
biologic-naïve patients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. More trials of direct comparisons are

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is not new and is under maintenance for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and spondylarthristis. The patient's age is 36, which is within the common onset age for ulcerative colitis. There is no information provided about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis.

Given this information, two top choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Infliximab and Adalimumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and spondylarthristis. It can reduce inflammation and achieve remission in many patients.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient for some patients. It can also cause side effects such as infections, allergic reactions, and liver damage.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is another TNF-alpha inhibitor that can be used to treat both conditions. It is administered via subcutaneous injection, which some patients may find more convenient than intravenous administration.
   - Disadvantages: Adalimumab can also cause side effects such as infections, allergic reactions, and liver damage. Some patients may not respond to Adalimumab or may lose response over time.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential for side effects. The patient should be closely monitored while on these medications for any adverse effects.

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

included. Phase 2 RCTs were excluded because of their small sample sizes and inclusion of doses not further explored 
in phase 3 RCTs. Summary data from intention-to-treat analyses were extracted from included reports by JSL and PAO. 
The primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission. A network meta-analysis was done under the frequentist

ABSTRACT 
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to 
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning 
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.  
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged 
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and 
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as 
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked 
according to their P-score. 
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical 
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is not new and is under maintenance for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The patient's age is 53, which is within the common age range for ulcerative colitis presentation. The patient's low albumin levels may indicate malnutrition or inflammation due to the disease. However, there is no information provided about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis.

Given this, two top choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Infliximab and Adalimumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can also improve quality of life and reduce hospitalizations and surgeries.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious infections and has been associated with a slight increase in the risk of lymphoma. It requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is another TNF-alpha inhibitor that can be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered subcutaneously, which some patients may find more convenient than intravenous administration.
   - Disadvantages: Like Infliximab, Adalimumab can cause serious infections and has been associated with a slight increase in the risk of lymphoma.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, including disease severity, comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal preferences.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is not new and has a history of prostate cancer. The patient's age is also a factor to consider in the treatment plan. 

Given this, the top two choices of biological drugs would be:

1. Infliximab
2. Vedolizumab

Infliximab:
Advantages: Infliximab has been ranked highest for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement in biologic-naive patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis. It has a proven track record of efficacy and safety.
Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may not be convenient for all patients. There is also a risk of developing antibodies against infliximab, which can reduce its effectiveness. 

Vedolizumab:
Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and is less likely to have systemic side effects. It is also recommended as a first-line therapy for moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis.
Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to work compared to other treatments. It is also administered via infusion, which may not be convenient for all patients. 

It's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health, preferences, and lifestyle.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets inflammation in the gut, reducing systemic side effects. It has been shown to be safe and effective for the bowel disease in patients with concurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
   - Disadvantages: While Vedolizumab is effective for the bowel disease, it does not improve liver biochemistry. This could be a disadvantage for this patient who has decompensated cirrhosis.

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is a new patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The patient's age is 48, and there is no mention of pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, pouchitis, or prior response to Infliximab, Anti-TNF agents, or Vedolizumab.

Given this, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also known for its rapid onset of action, which aligns with the patient's priority for a quick response to treatment.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects, including infections (such as tuberculosis), lymphoma, and other cancers. Patients may also develop antibodies to Infliximab, which can reduce its effectiveness.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and is less likely to cause systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: While Vedolizumab is generally well-tolerated, it may not work as quickly as other treatments. Some patients may also experience side effects such as headache, joint pain, nausea, or fever.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential for side effects. The patient should have a detailed discussion with her healthcare provider to decide on the best treatment option.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,"

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a preferred first-line agent for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It has a strong effect size for inducing clinical remission, making it a potent choice for patients who have lost response to other treatments.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab, like other biologics, can have side effects including risk of serious infections. Some patients may also develop anti-drug antibodies to Infliximab, reducing its effectiveness over time.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been found to be efficacious in patients who fail infliximab, and it has a superior safety profile, which may be attractive for patients concerned about side effects. It is also effective in inducing endoscopic improvement.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Ustekinumab is that it may not be as potent as Infliximab in inducing clinical remission. Additionally, as with all biologics, there is a risk of side effects, including serious infections.

It's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, including her overall health, lifestyle, and personal preferences.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized 
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs 
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is a new patient with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and extraintestinal manifestation (pyoderma gangrenosum). The patient has not been previously exposed to any biologic therapy. Considering the patient's age and disease severity, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It has also been used successfully in the treatment of extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease, including pyoderma gangrenosum.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab treatment may be associated with side effects such as increased risk of infections due to its immunosuppressive effect. There is also a risk of developing antibodies to Infliximab, which can lead to loss of response.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets the gut and is less likely to cause systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to show effects compared to other biologics. It may also be less effective in treating extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease compared to other biologics like Infliximab.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential risks and benefits.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel"

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also used to treat other autoimmune conditions, which could be beneficial if the patient has other autoimmune conditions in addition to ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab requires initial intravenous administration followed by subcutaneous injections, which can be inconvenient. It may also increase the risk of infections and has potential side effects including respiratory infections, fatigue, and headache.

It's important to note that the patient's optic neuritis should be considered when choosing a treatment, as some medications can worsen this condition.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is not new and is under maintenance for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The patient's age is 55 years old. There is no information provided about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis.

Given the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can also improve quality of life.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects including infections, lymphoma, and other cancers. Patients need to be monitored for these potential side effects.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets the gut and is less likely to cause systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab can cause side effects such as headache, joint pain, nausea, and fever. It may also increase the risk of infection.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential side effects of the drugs.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Human: question","Based on the patient's preference for oral medication and her condition of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Tofacitinib and Upadacitinib.

1. Tofacitinib:
   - Advantages: Tofacitinib is an oral medication, which aligns with the patient's preference. It has shown efficacy in managing moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can be a good first-line treatment option for patients who prefer oral medication.
   - Disadvantages: Tofacitinib may have potential side effects including increased risk of infections, elevated cholesterol levels, and potential risk of blood clots. It is also not recommended for patients with severe liver disease.

2. Upadacitinib:
   - Advantages: Upadacitinib is also an oral medication and has been suggested to be potentially more efficacious than other advanced therapies for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis based on ITT analyses.
   - Disadvantages: Similar to Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib may also have potential side effects including increased risk of infections. The long-term safety profile of Upadacitinib is still being studied.

It's important to note that the choice of medication should be made in consultation with the patient, taking into account the potential side effects, the patient's overall health status, and their lifestyle.",Tofacitinib,,,Upadacitinib,,,"title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is not new and has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The patient's age is 41, and there is no information about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, extraintestinale manifestations, or Pouchitis. 

Given this, two potential biological drugs for treatment could be Infliximab and Adalimumab. 

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a potent anti-TNF agent that has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can also improve quality of life and is administered via intravenous infusion, allowing for supervised treatment.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious infections and has been associated with a risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis. It can also cause infusion reactions and delayed hypersensitivity reactions.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is another anti-TNF agent that can be used in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered via subcutaneous injection, which can be done at home, providing convenience for the patient.
   - Disadvantages: Adalimumab can also cause serious infections and has been associated with a risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis. It can cause injection site reactions and has been associated with a risk of malignancy.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential for side effects. The patient should be closely monitored during treatment for any adverse effects.

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

field were contacted for any unpublished data.
We included phase 3 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria: 
(1) studies including adult (≥18 years) patients with 
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (defined as a Mayo 
Score of 6–12, with an endoscopic sub-score of 2–3) who 
were either biologic-naive or had previously been exposed 
to at least one biologic; (2) studies either evaluating the 
following biologics and small molecule drugs in their 
approved dose regimens, infliximab (intravenous or 
subcutaneous), adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab 
(intravenous or sub cutaneous), ustekinumab (intravenous 
or subcutaneous), tofacitinib, or ozanimod, or studies 
evaluating etroli zumab, upadacitinib, filgotinib, etrasimod,
