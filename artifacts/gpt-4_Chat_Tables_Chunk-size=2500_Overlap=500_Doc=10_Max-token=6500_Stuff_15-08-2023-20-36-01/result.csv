question

Let's think step by step.
","The patient is a 40-year-old male, newly diagnosed with moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) and has articular extraintestinal manifestations.

Based on the reference texts, the following two biological drugs could be considered:

1. Infliximab: This drug has shown efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It is also the preferred biologic for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with severe UC requiring hospitalization.

Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with moderate to severe UC. It is also beneficial for patients with extraintestinal manifestations.

Disadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects including infections, infusion reactions, and potential for immunogenicity. It is also administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Vedolizumab: This drug is an effective option for moderate UC and may be a better first-choice option than TNFi, given its safety profile.

Advantages: Vedolizumab has been shown to be superior to Adalimumab in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC. It is also less likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo.

Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may also not be feasible due to payer preference.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

and packaging.104 Currently, there is no recommendation
for whole foods–based management of IBD, but future
studies will delineate this further.
Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107
Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after
weighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC
requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for
induction and maintenance of remission, with or without
IMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-
ciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes
compared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a
monotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential
for the colon to act as a “sink” for drugs, we advocate for
checking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing
and detecting immunogenicity early along with other
pharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no
clear beneﬁt of concomitant mesalamine with biologic
therapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to
biologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe
UC
where
TNFi,
cyclosporine,
or
subtotal
colectomy
followed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good
initial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe
UC is beyond the scope of this article.
Taking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into
Consideration
EIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30%–40% of
patients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs
before IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration
across specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-
gists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to
prompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to
allow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,
but also to allow for consideration of both in the selection of","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

be related, in part, to limited access to care.54 Genes
implicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared

higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo, although etrolizumab 105mg was more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than golimumab 200/100mg, ustekinumab 6mg/kg,
vedolizumab 300mg, and infliximab 5mg/kg. Vedolizumab 300mg was the least likely drug
to lead to infections. Infections were significantly more likely with tofacitinib 10mg b.i.d.
than with either placebo or vedolizumab 300mg. Finally, withdrawals due to adverse events
were significantly less likely with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. than with placebo. Upadacitinib
45mg o.d. was significantly less likely to lead to withdrawals due to an adverse event than
infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg, vedolizumab 300mg, adalimumab 160/80mg or 80/40mg,
filgotinib 200mg o.d., and etrolizumab 105mg. Applying GRADE criteria to our estimates of
effects, certainty in the quality of evidence would be high.
There are some limitations. Only nine of 27 trials were at low risk of bias across all
domains. Given the timespan of included studies, there is the possibility that trials of newer
drugs included patients with refractory UC who had failed multiple other therapies. However,
some of these more recent trials only recruited patients who were naïve to anti-TNF-α","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features

PATIENT PROFILE:
question

Let's think step by step.
","Based on the patient's profile, she is a new patient with severe ulcerative colitis (UC). She is also an elderly patient, which may affect her treatment options. The reference text suggests that frailty, rather than chronological age, may be the driver of adverse outcomes in this group. However, it is also noted that elderly IBD patients present less commonly with complications, but there are similar or higher rates of surgery compared to a nonelderly population.

Given the patient's age and severity of UC, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in moderate to severe UC. It targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which is involved in the inflammation process in UC. In terms of endoscopic improvement, Infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for the patient. There may also be risks associated with its use, such as infections or other adverse events.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab targets α or β integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It is the least likely drug to lead to infections.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is also administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for the patient. There may also be risks associated with its use, such as infections or other adverse events.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health status, comorbidities, and preferences. The patient should be closely monitored for any adverse effects of the treatment.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo, although etrolizumab 105mg was more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than golimumab 200/100mg, ustekinumab 6mg/kg,
vedolizumab 300mg, and infliximab 5mg/kg. Vedolizumab 300mg was the least likely drug
to lead to infections. Infections were significantly more likely with tofacitinib 10mg b.i.d.
than with either placebo or vedolizumab 300mg. Finally, withdrawals due to adverse events
were significantly less likely with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. than with placebo. Upadacitinib
45mg o.d. was significantly less likely to lead to withdrawals due to an adverse event than
infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg, vedolizumab 300mg, adalimumab 160/80mg or 80/40mg,
filgotinib 200mg o.d., and etrolizumab 105mg. Applying GRADE criteria to our estimates of
effects, certainty in the quality of evidence would be high.
There are some limitations. Only nine of 27 trials were at low risk of bias across all
domains. Given the timespan of included studies, there is the possibility that trials of newer
drugs included patients with refractory UC who had failed multiple other therapies. However,
some of these more recent trials only recruited patients who were naïve to anti-TNF-α","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

Efficacy and Safety of Advanced Therapies
incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the
Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which
tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are
currently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-
verely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-
tolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi’s.4–7 All orally
administered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their
JAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and
UPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1
over JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-
erentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-
tional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs
of JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-
tively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P),
is also approved for use in UC.10
With this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid
toward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of
development for moderately to severely active UC. Most
recently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and
published a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist
network meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely
UC. Both studies assessed all outcomes after induction (6–14
weeks); Lasa et al11 additionally assessed efficacy after main-
tenance (26–66 weeks) separately for treat-through (TT) and"

PATIENT PROFILE:
question

Let's think step by step.
","Given the patient's profile, we can consider the following:

- The patient is not new and is under maintenance.
- The patient has had prior exposure to Infliximab but is not responding well to it.
- The patient does not have a prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, Vedolizumab, or Infliximab specifically mentioned.
- The patient's age is 35, which is a typical age for UC patients.
- Pregnancy is not applicable as the patient is male.
- There are no mentioned extraintestinal manifestations or pouchitis.

Based on the reference texts, two top choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Upadacitinib and Ustekinumab.

1. Upadacitinib:
   - Advantages: Upadacitinib has been ranked first in terms of clinical remission and clinical response in all patients, including those previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies like Infliximab. It also ranked first for endoscopic improvement in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies. It has similar safety across advanced therapies.
   - Disadvantages: Upadacitinib is a newer drug and long-term safety data may not be as robust as for older, more established drugs. It may also have lower odds of discontinuation due to adverse events during induction.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been ranked highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement. It is also recommended for patients with substantial comorbidities or contraindications to TNF antagonists.
   - Disadvantages: The efficacy of Ustekinumab may not be as high as Upadacitinib. It may also have lower odds versus placebo during maintenance for discontinuation due to adverse events.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

preferential janus kinase-1 inhibitor, although given filgotinib also has increased selectivity
for janus kinase-1 this cannot be the sole reason for upadacitinib’s higher ranking. Despite
these limitations, the results of our study are still useful for informing treatment decisions for
patients with moderate to severely active UC and can be used in future updates of evidence-
based management guidelines.
An initial network meta-analyses by Singh et al. demonstrated infliximab to be the
most efficacious drug for patients naïve to biological therapies in terms of induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, with vedolizumab ranked second.[22] In
patients exposed to biological therapies tofacitinib ranked first for both clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. An update to this work from 2020, including data from head-to-
head trials of vedolizumab and adalimumab, as well as phase III placebo-controlled trials of
ustekinumab, demonstrated again that infliximab was ranked first for induction of clinical
remission and endoscopic improvement in biologic-naïve patients, with ustekinumab and
tofacitinib ranked highest in patients previously exposed to biologics.[23] This later network
meta-analysis included 14 induction of remission trials, recruiting almost 5500 patients,
although the Japanese trial of infliximab versus placebo in 208 patients reported by
Kobayashi et al. was not included.[42] In contrast to these previous network meta-analyses,
our results provide hope that some novel drugs, which are likely to come to market soon, are
potentially more efficacious for moderate to severely active UC than existing licensed
therapies.
Our results confirm that all available drugs, other than adalimumab 160/160mg,
adalimumab 80/40mg, and filgotinib 100mg o.d. were more efficacious than placebo for the
treatment of moderate to severe UC, across all endpoints studied at 6 to 14 weeks. All drugs

PATIENT PROFILE:
question

Let's think step by step.
","Given the patient's profile, she is a new patient with moderate UC and has a background of congestive cardiac failure.

Based on the reference texts, two potential biological drugs for this patient could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

Vedolizumab is a drug that targets α or β integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. Ustekinumab is a drug that acts against other pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC.

Here are the pros and cons of these two drugs:

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: It has been tested and shown efficacy in clinical trials in moderate to severe UC. It targets α or β integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, potentially reducing inflammation.
   - Disadvantages: It may not work in all patients, and there may be risks associated with its use. It is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: It has also shown efficacy in clinical trials in moderate to severe UC. It acts against other pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, potentially reducing inflammation.
   - Disadvantages: Similar to Vedolizumab, it may not work in all patients, and there may be risks associated with its use. It is also administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health status, comorbidities, and preferences. The patient's congestive cardiac failure should also be taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan.

nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

Risk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication
at Diagnosis
Appropriately
risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

PATIENT PROFILE:
question

Let's think step by step.
","Based on the patient profile, the patient is newly diagnosed with moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) and also has psoriasis. This is her first treatment for UC, so she has no prior response to Infliximab or any other Anti-TNF agents. She has not failed any prior treatments as this is her first. Her age is not a significant factor in this case. Pregnancy is not mentioned, so it's assumed she is not pregnant. She has extraintestinal manifestations in the form of psoriasis. Pouchitis is not relevant as she has not undergone any surgery.

Given this profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Ustekinumab (UST) and Infliximab (IFX).

Ustekinumab is recommended as it has shown effectiveness in treating both UC and psoriasis. Infliximab is also a good choice as it has been ranked highly for efficacy in treating moderate to severe UC.

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

1. Ustekinumab (UST)
- Advantages: It is effective in treating both UC and psoriasis, which is beneficial for this patient as she has both conditions. It is also less likely to lead to serious adverse events than other drugs.
- Disadvantages: It may not be as effective as some other drugs in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in UC.

2. Infliximab (IFX)
- Advantages: It has been ranked highly for efficacy in treating moderate to severe UC. It is effective in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic improvement.
- Disadvantages: It may not be as effective in treating psoriasis. It also has a higher risk of adverse events compared to Ustekinumab.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Efficacy and Safety of Advanced Therapies
incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the
Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which
tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are
currently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-
verely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-
tolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi’s.4–7 All orally
administered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their
JAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and
UPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1
over JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-
erentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-
tional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs
of JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-
tively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P),
is also approved for use in UC.10
With this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid
toward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of
development for moderately to severely active UC. Most
recently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and
published a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist
network meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely
UC. Both studies assessed all outcomes after induction (6–14
weeks); Lasa et al11 additionally assessed efficacy after main-
tenance (26–66 weeks) separately for treat-through (TT) and","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

In the last 10 years small molecules, which can be administered orally and on a daily
basis, have also been evaluated in moderate to severe UC. These include janus kinase
inhibitors, such as tofacitinib,[20] and the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator,
ozanimod.[21] The comparative efficacy and safety of all these drugs has been assessed in
prior network meta-analyses.[22, 23] These demonstrated that infliximab was ranked highest
overall for efficacy, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
previous anti-TNF-α exposure. However, this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already
several newer drugs that have shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not
considered in these network meta-analyses.[24-26] We have therefore performed an updated
network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of all biological therapies and small molecules
that have progressed on to phase III trials, compared with each other or with placebo, in terms
of induction of remission, endoscopic improvement, and clinical response, as well as safety,
in patients with moderate to severely active UC.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo, although etrolizumab 105mg was more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than golimumab 200/100mg, ustekinumab 6mg/kg,
vedolizumab 300mg, and infliximab 5mg/kg. Vedolizumab 300mg was the least likely drug
to lead to infections. Infections were significantly more likely with tofacitinib 10mg b.i.d.
than with either placebo or vedolizumab 300mg. Finally, withdrawals due to adverse events
were significantly less likely with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. than with placebo. Upadacitinib
45mg o.d. was significantly less likely to lead to withdrawals due to an adverse event than
infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg, vedolizumab 300mg, adalimumab 160/80mg or 80/40mg,
filgotinib 200mg o.d., and etrolizumab 105mg. Applying GRADE criteria to our estimates of
effects, certainty in the quality of evidence would be high.
There are some limitations. Only nine of 27 trials were at low risk of bias across all
domains. Given the timespan of included studies, there is the possibility that trials of newer
drugs included patients with refractory UC who had failed multiple other therapies. However,
some of these more recent trials only recruited patients who were naïve to anti-TNF-α","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

PATIENT PROFILE:
question

Let's think step by step.
","Firstly, the patient is a young woman who is pregnant. This means that any treatment options need to be safe for both the mother and the unborn child.

Secondly, the patient has severe distal ulcerative colitis. This means that the disease is localized to the rectum and sigmoid colon, but the severity indicates that the disease is not well-controlled and may be causing significant symptoms and complications.

Given the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs could be:

1. Infliximab: This is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to induce and maintain remission in ulcerative colitis, and may also promote mucosal healing.

Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient. It can also cause side effects such as infections, allergic reactions, and potentially serious heart and liver problems. The safety of infliximab during pregnancy is not fully established, but it is generally considered to be low risk.

2. Vedolizumab: This is a newer biological therapy that targets alpha4-beta7 integrin, which is involved in the migration of immune cells to the inflamed intestinal mucosa.

Advantages: Vedolizumab is specifically designed to target the gut, which may reduce systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.

Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is also administered intravenously. It can cause side effects such as infections, headaches, and joint pain. The safety of vedolizumab during pregnancy is not fully established, but it is generally considered to be low risk.

It's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and preferences, and the potential risks and benefits should be discussed in detail with the patient.

(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and
waning, but the underlying systemic inﬂammation can lead
to progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinal
damage

Complications
associated
with
ongoing
inﬂammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, ﬁstulas,
abscesses, and surgery,3,16 and those associated with UC
include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and
colorectal cancer.2,4,17 Other complications include anemia,
nutritional deﬁciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-
sive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inﬂamma-
tion

associated
with

risking
permanent loss of height.18 Similar to other chronic dis-
eases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-
tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be
measured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.19
Limited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,
Symptoms, and Complications
The concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and
symptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a
population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-
mation may precede formal diagnosis.22 The STRIDE

ease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant to

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient."

PATIENT PROFILE:
question

Let's think step by step.
","First, we need to consider the patient's age. At 56 years old, the patient is not elderly, but age can still be a factor in the effectiveness and safety of certain treatments.

Second, the patient has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. This indicates that the patient may need stronger treatment options, such as biologics or small molecule drugs.

Third, the patient has ankylosing spondylitis, which is an extraintestinal manifestation. This could potentially affect the choice of treatment, as some drugs may be more effective for patients with certain extraintestinal manifestations.

Given these factors, the top two choices of biological drugs could be:

1. Infliximab: This drug has shown efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which is also involved in ankylosing spondylitis.

Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis.

Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. There may also be risks associated with its use, such as serious infections and lymphoma.

2. Adalimumab: This is another drug that targets TNF-α and has been tested for ulcerative colitis.

Advantages: Adalimumab has been shown to be effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is administered subcutaneously, which some patients may find more convenient than intravenous administration.

Disadvantages: As with infliximab, there may be risks associated with the use of adalimumab, including serious infections and lymphoma. Some patients may also have a reaction to the injection.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and in consultation with their healthcare provider.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

be related, in part, to limited access to care.54 Genes
implicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared
with White patients with IBD.55 Being aware of the
higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

Let's think step by step.
","Given the patient's profile, the patient has severe ulcerative colitis and has lost response to vedolizumab. This suggests that the patient may need a different treatment approach.

Based on the reference texts, two potential choices could be:

1. Infliximab: This drug has shown efficacy in clinical trials in moderate to severe UC. It targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).

Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing endoscopic improvement. It is also ranked first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.

Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. There may also be risks associated with its use.

2. Upadacitinib: This drug has shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials.

Advantages: Upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in terms of clinical remission and clinical response in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-TNF-α naïve. It also ranked first in terms of endoscopic improvement in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-TNF-α naïve.

Disadvantages: For discontinuation due to adverse events, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction. This suggests that there may be a higher risk of adverse events leading to discontinuation during the induction phase.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

interventions were observed when assessing adverse events and serious adverse events. Vedolizumab ranked lowest
for both adverse events (SUCRA 0·184) and serious adverse events (0·139), whereas upadacitinib ranked highest for
adverse events (0·843) and ozanimod ranked highest for serious adverse events (0·831).
Interpretation Upadacitinib was the best performing agent for the induction of clinical remission (the primary
outcome) but the worst performing agent in terms of adverse events in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative
colitis. Vedolizumab was the best performing agent for safety outcomes. With the paucity of direct comparisons in the
published literature, our results might help clinicians to position drugs in treatment algorithms.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,
namely vedolizumab and, more recently, usteki numab.

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

“safety” OR “adverse events”]. Additionally, experts in the
field were contacted for any unpublished data.
We included phase 3 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria:
(1) studies including adult (≥18 years) patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (defined as a Mayo
Score of 6–12, with an endoscopic sub-score of 2–3) who
were either biologic-naive or had previously been exposed
to at least one biologic; (2) studies either evaluating the
following biologics and small molecule drugs in their
approved dose regimens, infliximab (intravenous or
subcutaneous), adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab
(intravenous or sub cutaneous), ustekinumab (intravenous
or subcutaneous), tofacitinib, or ozanimod, or studies
evaluating etroli zumab, upadacitinib, filgotinib, etrasimod,
or TD-1473; (3) studies including an active comparator or
placebo; and (4) studies assessing the following outcomes:
clinical remission (defined as a Mayo score of ≤2, with no
individual sub-score >1) and endoscopic improvement
(Mayo endoscopic sub-score 0–1). We did not include
phase 2 trials because treatment effects can be over-
estimated or underestimated due to the intrinsically small
sample sizes of these studies. Additionally, given the dose-
ranging nature of phase 2 trials, many of them include
doses that will not be further explored in phase 3 trials.
For approved agents, only approved doses were
included in our analyses (intravenous infliximab:
5 mg/kg in weeks 0, 2, and 6 in induction, and 5 mg/kg
every 8 weeks in maintenance; subcutaneous infliximab:
120 mg every 2 weeks in maintenance; subcutaneous
adalimumab: 160 mg in week 0, 80 mg in week 2, and
40 mg in week 4 in induction, and 40 mg every other
week in maintenance; subcutaneous golimumab: 200 mg
in week 0 and 100 mg in week 2 in induction, and 100 mg
every 4 weeks in maintenance; intravenous vedolizumab:
300 mg in weeks 0, 2, and 6 in induction, and
300 mg every 8 weeks in maintenance; subcutaneous
vedolizumab: 108 mg every 2 weeks in maintenance;
ustekinumab: 6 mg/kg intravenously in week 0 in
induction, and 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks in
maintenance; oral tofacitinib: 10 mg twice daily for
8 weeks in induction, and 5 mg twice daily in
maintenance; and oral ozanimod: 1 mg daily in induction
and maintenance). For non-approved agents in a late

PATIENT PROFILE:
question

Let's think step by step.
","Given the patient's profile, we need to consider her age, the severity of her ulcerative colitis, and her history of lymphoma.

1. Age: At 28 years old, the patient is relatively young and should be able to tolerate most treatments for ulcerative colitis.

2. Severity of Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has severe extensive ulcerative colitis. This means that she may require more aggressive treatment options, such as biologics or small molecule drugs.

3. History of Lymphoma: This is a significant factor to consider when choosing a treatment. Some treatments for ulcerative colitis, particularly biologics like TNF-alpha inhibitors, can potentially increase the risk of reactivating lymphoma.

Given these factors, the top two choices of biological drugs could be:

1. Vedolizumab: This drug targets alpha4-beta7 integrin and is generally well-tolerated. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Advantages:
- It is gut-selective, meaning it specifically targets the gut and should have fewer systemic side effects.
- It does not carry an increased risk of malignancy, making it a safer choice for this patient with a history of lymphoma.

Disadvantages:
- It may take longer to see the effects of the drug, compared to other treatments.
- It is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Ustekinumab: This drug targets interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 and is used in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Advantages:
- It has a different mechanism of action that does not involve TNF-alpha, which is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma.
- It can be administered subcutaneously after the initial intravenous dose.

Disadvantages:
- It is relatively new in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, so long-term safety data is still being collected.
- It may not be as effective as other treatments in severe cases.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

mechanism of action may be due to decrease in immuno-

PATIENT PROFILE:
question

Let's think step by step.
","Based on the patient profile, the patient is a new patient with moderate ulcerative colitis and also has multiple sclerosis. The patient's age is 36 and she is a woman. There is no information about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, extraintestinale manifestations, or pouchitis.

Given the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

Vedolizumab specifically targets the gut and may have fewer systemic side effects, which could be beneficial for a patient with multiple sclerosis. However, it may not be as effective as other treatments for ulcerative colitis.

Ustekinumab is used to treat both ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis, potentially offering a two-in-one solution for this patient. However, it is usually used when other treatments have failed and its long-term effects are not well-studied.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

41 years (interquartile range, 40–42 y), and 60%
(interquartile range, 56%–63%) were men. The median
disease duration was 6.7 years (interquartile range,
6.0–7.8 y), and 49% (interquartile range, 46%–55%) of
patients had extensive colitis. A median of 40% (inter-
quartile range, 30%–50%) of patients were treated with
concomitant immunomodulators, and 51% (interquartile
range, 45%–57%) were on corticosteroids at baseline.

less frequent requirement of immunosuppression in pa-
tients diagnosed after age 60 years,47 and a meta-analysis
suggested
that,
although
elderly
IBD
presents
less
commonly with complications, there are similar or higher
rates of surgery compared to a nonelderly population.48 It is
being increasingly recognized that frailty, rather than
chronologic age, may be the driver of adverse outcomes in
this group.49,50
Other Demographic Variables
There are signiﬁcant differences in IBD phenotype
and outcomes based on race and ethnicity, likely due to
a multitude of factors, both social and biologic. Emer-
gency department use, hospitalization, complicated dis-
ease
course,
and
IBD-related
disability
are
more
common in minority and lower socioeconomic status
groups.51,52 In a study of 770 patients with IBD, South
Asian immigrants living in the United Kingdom were
more
likely
to
have
extensive
UC
and
colonic
CD
compared with their native counterparts,53 which might
be related, in part, to limited access to care.54 Genes
implicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared
with White patients with IBD.55 Being aware of the
higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58
