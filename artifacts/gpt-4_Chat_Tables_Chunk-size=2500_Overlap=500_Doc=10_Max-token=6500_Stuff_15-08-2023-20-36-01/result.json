However, treatment limitations for \nmoderately to severely active UC remain, including primary \nnonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and \nparenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, \nthere has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs \n(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-\nnogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the \nJanus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which \ntofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are \ncurrently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-\nverely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-\ntolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally \nadministered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their \nJAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and \nUPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 \nover JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-\nerentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-\ntional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs \nof JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-\ntively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), \nis also approved for use in UC.10\nWith this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid \ntoward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of \ndevelopment for moderately to severely active UC. Most \nrecently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and \npublished a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist \nnetwork meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely \nUC.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued."}, {"title": "", "filename": "otad009.pdf", "page": 0, "text": "discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections.

Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by \nadjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.\nResults:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

However, treatment limitations for \nmoderately to severely active UC remain, including primary \nnonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and \nparenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, \nthere has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs \n(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-\nnogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the \nJanus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which \ntofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are \ncurrently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-\nverely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-\ntolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally \nadministered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their \nJAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and \nUPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 \nover JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-\nerentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-\ntional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs \nof JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-\ntively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), \nis also approved for use in UC.10\nWith this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid \ntoward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of \ndevelopment for moderately to severely active UC. Most \nrecently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and \npublished a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist \nnetwork meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely \nUC.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

This means that any treatment options need to be safe for both the mother and the unborn child. \n\nSecondly, the patient has severe distal ulcerative colitis. This means that the disease is localized to the rectum and sigmoid colon, but the severity indicates that the disease is not well-controlled and may be causing significant symptoms and complications.\n\nGiven the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs could be:\n\n1. Infliximab: This is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. \n\nAdvantages: Infliximab has been shown to induce and maintain remission in ulcerative colitis, and may also promote mucosal healing. \n\nDisadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient. It can also cause side effects such as infections, allergic reactions, and potentially serious heart and liver problems. The safety of infliximab during pregnancy is not fully established, but it is generally considered to be low risk.\n\n2.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

A useful adjunct\nto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool\nmarker of in\ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC \ufffd 40 mg/\ng carried a \ufffd1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index \ufffd8 and/\nor FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to\n100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional\nimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.\nWe refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn\u2019s and\nColitis\nOrganization,\nand\nBritish\nSociety\nof\nGastro-\nenterology.37\u201340\nRisk Strati\ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately\nrisk-stratifying\nprognosis\nin\npatients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection\nof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-\ngies.

At 56 years old, the patient is not elderly, but age can still be a factor in the effectiveness and safety of certain treatments. \n\nSecond, the patient has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. This indicates that the patient may need stronger treatment options, such as biologics or small molecule drugs.\n\nThird, the patient has ankylosing spondylitis, which is an extraintestinal manifestation. This could potentially affect the choice of treatment, as some drugs may be more effective for patients with certain extraintestinal manifestations.\n\nGiven these factors, the top two choices of biological drugs could be:\n\n1. Infliximab: This drug has shown efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which is also involved in ankylosing spondylitis. \n\nAdvantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis. \n\nDisadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. There may also be risks associated with its use, such as serious infections and lymphoma.\n\n2. Adalimumab: This is another drug that targets TNF-\u03b1 and has been tested for ulcerative colitis. \n\nAdvantages: Adalimumab has been shown to be effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is administered subcutaneously, which some patients may find more convenient than intravenous administration.\n\nDisadvantages: As with infliximab, there may be risks associated with the use of adalimumab, including serious infections and lymphoma. Some patients may also have a reaction to the injection.\n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and in consultation with their healthcare provider.\n\n[{\"drug_name\": \"Infliximab\", \"advantages\": \"Effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis\", \"disadvantages\": \"Administered intravenously, potential risks such as serious infections and lymphoma\"}, {\"drug_name\": \"Adalimumab\", \"advantages\": \"Effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis, administered subcutaneously\", \"disadvantages\": \"Potential risks such as serious infections and lymphoma, possible reaction to injection\"}]", "sources": [{"title": "Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis", "filename": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf", "page": 7, "text": "Burr et al. \n \n7 of 45 \nINTRODUCTION \n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Age: At 28 years old, the patient is relatively young and should be able to tolerate most treatments for ulcerative colitis.\n\n2. Severity of Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has severe extensive ulcerative colitis. This means that she may require more aggressive treatment options, such as biologics or small molecule drugs.\n\n3. History of Lymphoma: This is a significant factor to consider when choosing a treatment. Some treatments for ulcerative colitis, particularly biologics like TNF-alpha inhibitors, can potentially increase the risk of reactivating lymphoma. \n\nGiven these factors, the top two choices of biological drugs could be:\n\n1.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.
