[{"question": "40 year old male with newly diagnosed moderate UC and articular extraintestinal manifestations\n", "answer": "Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Ustekinumab. \n\n1. Infliximab:\n   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in treating both UC and rheumatological manifestations, which are common extraintestinal manifestations in IBD patients. It has well-established efficacies in most rheumatological indications.\n   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is an anti-TNF agent and patients can develop antibodies against it, leading to loss of response. Regular monitoring is required to ensure therapeutic levels and to detect immunogenicity early.\n\n2. Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is also indicated in rheumatoid arthritis, which suggests it could be beneficial for patients with articular manifestations. It is also an effective option for moderate UC.\n   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab has a limited role in treating articular manifestations compared to Infliximab. It may not be as effective in managing the patient's extraintestinal manifestations.\n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific symptoms, disease severity, and potential side effects. Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of the treatment. \n\n[{\"drug_name\": \"Infliximab\", \"advantages\": \"Effective in treating both UC and rheumatological manifestations\", \"disadvantages\": \"Patients can develop antibodies against it, leading to loss of response\"}, {\"drug_name\": \"Ustekinumab\", \"advantages\": \"Indicated in rheumatoid arthritis and effective for moderate UC\", \"disadvantages\": \"Limited role in treating articular manifestations compared to Infliximab\"}]", "source_document": [{"text": "This review summarizes the existing litera-ture on, and proposes a framework for how to best manage,CD and UC early in the disease course in adult and pediatric\npatients.\nEarly Diagnosis and Treatment:\nGateways for Improved Prognosis in\nIn\ufb02ammatory Bowel Diseases\nIn\ufb02ammatory Bowel Diseases Are Progressive\nDiseases\nThe natural history of both CD and UC can vary from\nmild disease with few symptoms to complicated diseasewith strictures and \ufb01stulas.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc \n(CRDSA), AGAF ,\u00b6 Christina S.\u00a0Kwon , PhD,# Wen\u00a0Zhou, MD, PhD,** Dapo\u00a0Ilo , MBBS, MRCS, MSC, \nMBA,** Dolly\u00a0Sharma, PhD,** Yuri\u00a0Sanchez Gonzalez, MS, MSc, PhD,**, and  \nSi-Tien\u00a0Wang, MS\u2020,\n*Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unit, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada\n\u2020Medicus Economics LLC, Milton, Massachusetts, USA\n\u2021Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA\n\u00a7Department of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, University Hospital Leuven, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium\n\u2016Gastroenterology and Endoscopy, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Department of Gastroenterology, University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, \nItaly\n\u00b6Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA\n#Cytel, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA\n**AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA\nAddress correspondence to: Remo Panaccione, MD, FRCPC, Rm 6D32, TRW Building, 3280 Hospitals Drive NW, Calgary, AB T3R1B1, Canada (rpanacci@\nucalgary.ca).\nBackground:  Given rapid innovation in advanced therapies for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), we investigated their com-\nparative efficacy and safety during induction and maintenance through network meta-analysis.\nMethods:  Using Bayesian methods, endpoints of clinical remission and clinical response per Full Mayo score, and endoscopic improvement \nwere assessed in bio-naive and -exposed populations.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16]

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "The following are knowledge sequence in max depth 2 in the form of directed graph

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "2 Cohen RD, Yu AP, Wu EQ, Xie J, Mulani PM, Chao J.

It also requires intravenous administration which may not be convenient for all patients.\n\n2. Adalimumab:\n   - Advantages: Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for some patients.\n   - Disadvantages: TNF-alpha inhibitors like Adalimumab have been associated with an increased risk of malignancies, which could be a concern for this patient with a history of lymphoma.

This could be beneficial for this patient as she also has multiple sclerosis, a neurological condition, and Vedolizumab is less likely to exacerbate her MS symptoms.\n   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Vedolizumab is that it may take longer to work compared to other biologics. Some patients may not see improvement in their symptoms until after several weeks of treatment.\n\n2. Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is another option that could be considered. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It works by blocking interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, which are involved in the inflammatory process.\n   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Ustekinumab is that it may increase the risk of infections.

that causes \ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] a nd the \ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of diseas e activity, \nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "2 Cohen RD, Yu AP, Wu EQ, Xie J, Mulani PM, Chao J.

For maintenance therapy, the top two choices of biological drugs would be:\n\n1. Vedolizumab: Since the patient had a successful induction with vedolizumab, it would be reasonable to continue with vedolizumab as maintenance therapy. Vedolizumab is an integrin receptor antagonist that specifically targets the gut-homing lymphocytes, reducing inflammation in the gut. It has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission and improving endoscopic outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis. The advantage of continuing with vedolizumab is that the patient has already responded well to this medication during the induction phase. However, it is important to monitor for any potential side effects or adverse reactions.\n\n2. Ustekinumab: Another option for maintenance therapy in this patient could be ustekinumab. Ustekinumab is an interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 antagonist that has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. In the context of prior exposure to vedolizumab, ustekinumab has been ranked highest for inducing endoscopic improvement. Therefore, ustekinumab could be considered as an alternative maintenance therapy option. However, it is important to note that the patient's response to ustekinumab may vary and close monitoring is necessary.\n\nIt is important to discuss these options with the patient's healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate maintenance therapy based on the patient's individual characteristics and preferences.", "source_document": [{"text": "across estimates (I2<30%) ( Supplementary Figure 3 B).

Two potential choices for biological drugs in this case are:\n\n1. Tofacitinib:\n   - Advantages: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that has shown efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It works by inhibiting the signaling pathways involved in inflammation. Tofacitinib has been shown to induce and maintain clinical remission, mucosal healing, and corticosteroid-free remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.\n   - Disadvantages: Tofacitinib carries a risk of serious infections, including opportunistic infections, as well as an increased risk of malignancies, thromboembolic events, and gastrointestinal perforation. It requires regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function, and lipid levels.\n\n2. Golimumab:\n   - Advantages: Golimumab is a subcutaneously administered anti-TNF agent that has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining clinical response, remission, and mucosal healing. Golimumab can be used as monotherapy or in combination with immunomodulators.\n   - Disadvantages: Golimumab carries similar risks and side effects as other anti-TNF agents, including an increased risk of infections, infusion reactions, and the development of antibodies that can reduce its effectiveness. It requires regular monitoring and may not be suitable for patients with a history of heart failure.\n\nIt is important to note that the choice of biological drug should be made in consultation with a gastroenterologist or healthcare provider who can consider the patient's specific medical history, comorbidities, and individual factors.", "source_document": [{"text": "Major congresses\u2019 databases (European Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Organization, Digestive Disease Week, and United European Gastroenterology Week) were also reviewed manually from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021.

Biologics with other targets were later approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, \nnamely vedolizumab and, more recently, usteki  numab. \nHowever, treatment with biologics has several \nlimit   ations, including limited efficacy, primary non-\nresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity,", "metadata": {"page_label": 1, "file_name": "1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf"}}, {"text": "Ustekinumab, however, has also limited\nrole in this indication, as this drug is also indicated in rheumatoid\narthritis ( Kerschbaumer et al., 2020 ).

It may be a good option if the patient does not respond to or cannot tolerate Infliximab.\n   - Disadvantages: Similar to Infliximab, Adalimumab can increase the risk of infections and may cause allergic reactions. It also requires subcutaneous injection, which some patients may find inconvenient or uncomfortable.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, including disease severity, comorbidities, and personal preferences.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "Very limited data are\navailable regarding ustekinumab in early CD. In a retrospective pediatric\ncohort, treated with ustekinumab, the rate of remission was 61.1% in\npatients despite prior anti-TNF failure, suggesting a high potential with\nthis agent in early disease ( Kim et al., 2021 ).\nDifferentiation can also be made on the extension and location of disease\nwhich may have a direct impact on the response to biological treatment\n(Atreya and Siegmund, 2021 ).Ina recent genetic association study, Cleynen\net al. determinedthat the separation of IBD between ileal CD, colonic CDand\nUC could be considered as a continuum of phenotypes, to which speci \ufb01c risk\nscore could be applied ( Cleynen et al., 2016 ). Concerning disease behavior,\nbetter results were obtained in CD with anti-TNF agents in patients with\nnon-stricturing, non-penetrating disease (B1 according to the Montr /C19eal\nclassi\ufb01cation), as compared to stricturing disease (B2) or \ufb01stulizing disease\n(B3) ( Moran etal., 2014 ;Bouhnik etal., 2018 ;Nunez-Gomez etal.,2018 ).In\nUC, only limited data are available to guide therapy of isolated proctitiswith\nbiological agents.

In the former, the surfaceunder the cumulative ranking (SUCRA), a measure of therelative ranking of each treatment, is used for comparisons.SUCRA ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher number indicatinghigher ranking. For the management of early moderate tosevere CD, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) remainthe mainstay of treatment. In a network meta-analysis ofrandomized controlled trial data,\n87in\ufb02iximab (IFX) and\nadalimumab (ADA) were superior to other therapies for\nmoderate CD (SUCRA 0.93 and 0.75, respectively). Of note,biosimilars are approved as inexpensive alternatives to\nIFX.88Ustekinumab (UST) was associated with a lower risk\nof serious adverse events and infections (SUCRA 0.72 and0.71, respectively), and may be a consideration among risk-averse patients. In moderate CD, especially when limited tothe colon and no high-risk features, vedolizumab (VDZ) andUST are ef \ufb01cacious \ufb01rst-line options with good safety\npro\ufb01les. In addition, although response to VDZ is lower\namong TNFi exposed, biologic-na\u00efve patients have higherrates of response.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "2 Cohen RD, Yu AP, Wu EQ, Xie J, Mulani PM, Chao J.

It has been evaluated in a large, dedicated placebo-randomized trial for fistula treatment, showing good results.\n   - Disadvantages: Infliximab has not shown efficacy in primary sclerosing cholangitis, which the patient also has. Additionally, it may have side effects such as increased risk of infection, allergic reactions, and potential liver damage, which could be a concern given the patient's decompensated cirrhosis.\n\n2.

It is also used for treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.\n   - Disadvantages: Similar to Infliximab, Adalimumab has not shown efficacy in primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "2 Cohen RD, Yu AP, Wu EQ, Xie J, Mulani PM, Chao J.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "2 Cohen RD, Yu AP, Wu EQ, Xie J, Mulani PM, Chao J.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease.

that causes \ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] a nd the \ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of diseas e activity, \nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1 \u201310 years\nafter diagnosis.9In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,\nstricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianaldisease in 25% of patients.\n10At the other end of the spec-\ntrum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% ofindividuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an\nuncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.\n11\nWith respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate\nseverity and 10% \u201315% of patients can experience a severe\ncourse.12In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid\nlocation of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years offollow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.\n13The\nrisk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreasedsigni\ufb01cantly during the last 6 decades.\n14\nThe symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and\nwaning, but the underlying systemic in \ufb02ammation can lead\nto progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinaldamage and risk of complications if not treatedadequately.\n15Complications associated with ongoing\nin\ufb02ammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, \ufb01stulas,\nabscesses, and surgery,3,16and those associated with UC\ninclude loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, andcolorectal cancer.\n2,4,17Other complications include anemia,\nnutritional de \ufb01ciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-\nsive loss of quality of life.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosa licylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity, [3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF -\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF- \u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa , \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.", "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf"}}, {"text": "Trials of in \ufb02iximab (Active Ulcerative Colitis Trials\n1 and 2,17Jiang et al,18NCT0155129019), adalimumab\n(Ulcerative colitis Long-Term Remission and maintenancewith Adalimumab 2,\n20,21Suzuki et al22), vedolizumab\n(GEMINI I,24Motoya et al,25VARSITY6) and ustekinumab\n(UNIFI7) also reported outcomes on maintenance therapy\nwithin the same publication; Program of Ulcerative Colitis\nResearch Studies Utilizing an Investigational Treatment-M, Program of Ulcerative Colitis Research Studies Utilizingan Investigational Treatment-J, and OCTAVE-Sustainreported outcomes for maintenance therapy withgolimumab and tofacitinib, respectively.\n26\u201328From our\nprevious analysis, 3 additional studies were included.The schematic diagram of study selection is shown in\nSupplementary Figure 1 , and available direct\ncomparisons and network of trials are shown in Figure 1 .\nTrial and patient characteristics are summarized in\nTable 1 .
