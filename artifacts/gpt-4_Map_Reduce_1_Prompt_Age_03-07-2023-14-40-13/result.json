Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by \nadjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.\nResults:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were \nhighest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance \namong bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or \nserious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to \nAEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during \nmaintenance.\nConclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety \nacross advanced therapies.\nLay Summary \nIndirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-\nsion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across \nadvanced therapies.\nKey Words: ulcerative colitis, clinical trials, advanced therapies, network meta-analysis\nIntroduction\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-\nease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized \nby bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-\nlaise, weight loss, and fever.

Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index\nconsisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage\nand identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely\nmanner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct\nto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool\nmarker of in\ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC \ufffd 40 mg/\ng carried a \ufffd1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index \ufffd8 and/\nor FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to\n100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional\nimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.\nWe refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn\u2019s and\nColitis\nOrganization,\nand\nBritish\nSociety\nof\nGastro-\nenterology.37\u201340\nRisk Strati\ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately\nrisk-stratifying\nprognosis\nin\npatients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection\nof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-\ngies.

Certain baseline clinical features\nare associated with a more aggressive disease course with\nhigher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk\npatients, early control of in\ufb02ammation with immune-\nmodifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-\nsive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the\nshort- and long-term, and entail signi\ufb01cant health care costs.\nTherefore, a consideration of risks, bene\ufb01ts, and alternatives\nis key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the\ninformed patient."}]}, {"question": "38 year old female with newly diagnosed moderate UC and psoriasis", "answer": "Based on the reference text, the top two choices of biological drugs for a 38-year-old female with newly diagnosed moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) and psoriasis are:\n\n1.

However, treatment limitations for \nmoderately to severely active UC remain, including primary \nnonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and \nparenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, \nthere has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs \n(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-\nnogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the \nJanus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which \ntofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are \ncurrently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-\nverely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-\ntolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally \nadministered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their \nJAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and \nUPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 \nover JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-\nerentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-\ntional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs \nof JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-\ntively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), \nis also approved for use in UC.10\nWith this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid \ntoward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of \ndevelopment for moderately to severely active UC. Most \nrecently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and \npublished a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist \nnetwork meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely \nUC.

Biologics with other targets were later approved \nfor the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, \nnamely vedolizumab and, more recently, usteki numab. \nHowever, \ntreatment \nwith \nbiologics \nhas \nseveral \nlimit ations, including limited efficacy, primary non-\nresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity,"}, {"title": "First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis", "filename": "PIIS1542356520300446.pdf", "page": 1, "text": "What You Need to Know\nBackground\nA systematic review and network meta-analysis is\nneeded to compare ef\ufb01cacy and safety of \ufb01rst-line\n(biologic-na\u00efve) and second-line (prior exposure to\ntumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for\ntreatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative\ncolitis.\nFindings\nIn\ufb02iximab was ranked highest in biologic-na\u00efve pa-\ntients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked\nhighest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-\ntagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic\nimprovement.
