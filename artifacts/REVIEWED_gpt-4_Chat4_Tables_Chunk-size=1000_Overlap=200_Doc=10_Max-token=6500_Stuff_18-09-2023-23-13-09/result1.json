Considering the patient's age and disease severity, biological drugs would be a suitable treatment option. \n\nHere are two top choices of biological drugs for this patient:\n\n1. Infliximab\n   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can also help manage extraintestinal manifestations like pyoderma gangrenosum. Infliximab has a rapid onset of action, which can be beneficial in patients with severe symptoms.\n   - Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects, including infections, lymphoma, and other cancers. It can also cause infusion reactions, which can be severe. Some patients may develop antibodies to infliximab, which can reduce its effectiveness.\n\n2. Vedolizumab\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets the gut and is less likely to cause systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.\n   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may not be as effective in managing extraintestinal manifestations like pyoderma gangrenosum. It also has a slower onset of action compared to TNF-alpha inhibitors. Some patients may experience side effects like headache, joint pain, nausea, or fever.\n\nThese are general pros and cons, and the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances and preferences.

It can also improve quality of life and reduce the need for hospitalization and surgery.\n- Disadvantages: Infliximab can cause serious side effects, including infections (such as tuberculosis), lymphoma, and other cancers. It can also cause liver damage, heart failure, and allergic reactions. It requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient for some patients.\n\nVedolizumab:\n- Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin blocker that has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It has a good safety profile and is less likely to cause serious infections compared to other biologics.\n- Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may not work as quickly as other biologics, and it may not be as effective in patients who have previously failed other biologic therapies. It also requires intravenous administration.\n\nPlease note that the choice of therapy should be individualized based on the patient's specific circumstances, including disease severity, comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal preferences.

Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, which are involved in the inflammatory process of ulcerative colitis. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Additionally, Ustekinumab has been used in the treatment of psoriasis, a condition that, like alopecia areata, is an autoimmune skin disorder. Therefore, it might also have beneficial effects on the patient's alopecia areata.\n   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may increase the risk of infections, including tuberculosis, bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections, and other opportunistic infections. It may also increase the risk of malignancies.\n\n2. Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, which is involved in the migration of leukocytes into the gut, thus reducing inflammation in ulcerative colitis. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Vedolizumab is gut-selective, which means it does not affect systemic immune responses and therefore has a lower risk of systemic side effects.\n   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may increase the risk of infections. It may take longer to work compared to other treatments, and some patients may not respond to the treatment.
