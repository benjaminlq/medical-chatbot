Firstly, the patient is a newly diagnosed case of moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). This means he has not been previously treated with any biological drugs for UC.

Secondly, the patient has articular extraintestinal manifestations. This means that the patient's UC is affecting other parts of his body, specifically his joints.

Given these factors, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Vedolizumab and Infliximab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and may have fewer systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.
   - Disadvantages: It may not be as effective in treating extraintestinal manifestations such as joint problems. It is also administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in treating both UC and its extraintestinal manifestations, including joint problems. It is also effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is a systemic immunosuppressant, which means it affects the entire body and may have more side effects. It is also administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

and packaging.104 Currently, there is no recommendation
for whole foods–based management of IBD, but future
studies will delineate this further.
Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107
Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after
weighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC
requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for
induction and maintenance of remission, with or without
IMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-
ciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes
compared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a
monotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential
for the colon to act as a “sink” for drugs, we advocate for
checking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing
and detecting immunogenicity early along with other
pharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no
clear beneﬁt of concomitant mesalamine with biologic
therapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to
biologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe
UC
where
TNFi,
cyclosporine,
or
subtotal
colectomy
followed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good
initial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe
UC is beyond the scope of this article.
Taking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into
Consideration
EIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30%–40% of
patients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs
before IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration
across specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-
gists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to
prompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to
allow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,
but also to allow for consideration of both in the selection of","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

compared with their native counterparts,53 which might
be related, in part, to limited access to care.54 Genes
implicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared
with White patients with IBD.55 Being aware of the
higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo, although etrolizumab 105mg was more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than golimumab 200/100mg, ustekinumab 6mg/kg,
vedolizumab 300mg, and infliximab 5mg/kg. Vedolizumab 300mg was the least likely drug
to lead to infections. Infections were significantly more likely with tofacitinib 10mg b.i.d.
than with either placebo or vedolizumab 300mg. Finally, withdrawals due to adverse events
were significantly less likely with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. than with placebo. Upadacitinib
45mg o.d. was significantly less likely to lead to withdrawals due to an adverse event than
infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg, vedolizumab 300mg, adalimumab 160/80mg or 80/40mg,
filgotinib 200mg o.d., and etrolizumab 105mg. Applying GRADE criteria to our estimates of
effects, certainty in the quality of evidence would be high.
There are some limitations. Only nine of 27 trials were at low risk of bias across all
domains. Given the timespan of included studies, there is the possibility that trials of newer
drugs included patients with refractory UC who had failed multiple other therapies. However,
some of these more recent trials only recruited patients who were naïve to anti-TNF-α","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

Firstly, the patient is a 70-year-old female who has been newly diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis (UC). This means she has not been previously treated for UC and her disease is severe.

Secondly, considering her age, we need to be cautious about the choice of treatment. Some treatments may have more side effects in older patients or may be contraindicated due to other comorbidities common in this age group.

Based on the reference texts, two potential choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

Let's analyze the pros and cons of these two choices:

1. Infliximab:
- Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. It is also beneficial for patients with extraintestinal manifestations of UC.
- Disadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects including risk of infections, infusion reactions, and potential for drug-induced lupus. It is also administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: Vedolizumab is also effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. It is gut-selective, meaning it specifically targets the gut and is less likely to cause systemic side effects.
- Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to work compared to other treatments. It also requires intravenous administration.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo, although etrolizumab 105mg was more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than golimumab 200/100mg, ustekinumab 6mg/kg,
vedolizumab 300mg, and infliximab 5mg/kg. Vedolizumab 300mg was the least likely drug
to lead to infections. Infections were significantly more likely with tofacitinib 10mg b.i.d.
than with either placebo or vedolizumab 300mg. Finally, withdrawals due to adverse events
were significantly less likely with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. than with placebo. Upadacitinib
45mg o.d. was significantly less likely to lead to withdrawals due to an adverse event than
infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg, vedolizumab 300mg, adalimumab 160/80mg or 80/40mg,
filgotinib 200mg o.d., and etrolizumab 105mg. Applying GRADE criteria to our estimates of
effects, certainty in the quality of evidence would be high.
There are some limitations. Only nine of 27 trials were at low risk of bias across all
domains. Given the timespan of included studies, there is the possibility that trials of newer
drugs included patients with refractory UC who had failed multiple other therapies. However,
some of these more recent trials only recruited patients who were naïve to anti-TNF-α","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Efficacy and Safety of Advanced Therapies
incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the
Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which
tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are
currently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-
verely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-
tolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi’s.4–7 All orally
administered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their
JAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and
UPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1
over JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-
erentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-
tional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs
of JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-
tively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P),
is also approved for use in UC.10
With this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid
toward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of
development for moderately to severely active UC. Most
recently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and
published a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist
network meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely
UC. Both studies assessed all outcomes after induction (6–14
weeks); Lasa et al11 additionally assessed efficacy after main-
tenance (26–66 weeks) separately for treat-through (TT) and"

Human: question
Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's profile:
- The patient has moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) and has been previously treated with infliximab.
- Despite compliance, the patient's condition is worsening as seen on endoscopy.

From the reference texts, we can gather the following information:
- Infliximab is a commonly used drug for treating moderate to severe UC. However, in this case, the patient's condition is worsening despite its use.
- Upadacitinib 45mg o.d. has been ranked first in terms of clinical remission and clinical response in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, such as infliximab.
- Ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement.

Given this information, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Upadacitinib and Ustekinumab.

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

1. Upadacitinib
- Advantages: It has shown high efficacy in inducing clinical remission and response in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies. It also ranked first in terms of endoscopic improvement in these patients.
- Disadvantages: As a newer drug, long-term safety data might not be as robust as for older, more established drugs.

2. Ustekinumab
- Advantages: It has been ranked highly for inducing remission and endoscopic improvement in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists. It might be a good option for patients who have not responded well to these therapies.
- Disadvantages: It may not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

preferential janus kinase-1 inhibitor, although given filgotinib also has increased selectivity
for janus kinase-1 this cannot be the sole reason for upadacitinib’s higher ranking. Despite
these limitations, the results of our study are still useful for informing treatment decisions for
patients with moderate to severely active UC and can be used in future updates of evidence-
based management guidelines.
An initial network meta-analyses by Singh et al. demonstrated infliximab to be the
most efficacious drug for patients naïve to biological therapies in terms of induction of
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, with vedolizumab ranked second.[22] In
patients exposed to biological therapies tofacitinib ranked first for both clinical remission and
endoscopic improvement. An update to this work from 2020, including data from head-to-
head trials of vedolizumab and adalimumab, as well as phase III placebo-controlled trials of
ustekinumab, demonstrated again that infliximab was ranked first for induction of clinical
remission and endoscopic improvement in biologic-naïve patients, with ustekinumab and
tofacitinib ranked highest in patients previously exposed to biologics.[23] This later network
meta-analysis included 14 induction of remission trials, recruiting almost 5500 patients,
although the Japanese trial of infliximab versus placebo in 208 patients reported by
Kobayashi et al. was not included.[42] In contrast to these previous network meta-analyses,
our results provide hope that some novel drugs, which are likely to come to market soon, are
potentially more efficacious for moderate to severely active UC than existing licensed
therapies.
Our results confirm that all available drugs, other than adalimumab 160/160mg,
adalimumab 80/40mg, and filgotinib 100mg o.d. were more efficacious than placebo for the
treatment of moderate to severe UC, across all endpoints studied at 6 to 14 weeks. All drugs
were safe and well-tolerated, with no significant increase in serious adverse events or adverse
events leading to withdrawal over the rates seen in the placebo arms, although the RR of","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

We included phase 3 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria:
(1) studies including adult (≥18 years) patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (defined as a Mayo
Score of 6–12, with an endoscopic sub-score of 2–3) who
were either biologic-naive or had previously been exposed
to at least one biologic; (2) studies either evaluating the
following biologics and small molecule drugs in their
approved dose regimens, infliximab (intravenous or
subcutaneous), adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab
(intravenous or sub cutaneous), ustekinumab (intravenous
or subcutaneous), tofacitinib, or ozanimod, or studies
evaluating etroli zumab, upadacitinib, filgotinib, etrasimod,
or TD-1473; (3) studies including an active comparator or
placebo; and (4) studies assessing the following outcomes:
clinical remission (defined as a Mayo score of ≤2, with no
individual sub-score >1) and endoscopic improvement
(Mayo endoscopic sub-score 0–1). We did not include
phase 2 trials because treatment effects can be over-
estimated or underestimated due to the intrinsically small
sample sizes of these studies. Additionally, given the dose-
ranging nature of phase 2 trials, many of them include
doses that will not be further explored in phase 3 trials.
For approved agents, only approved doses were
included in our analyses (intravenous infliximab:

Firstly, the patient is newly diagnosed with moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). This means she has not been previously treated with any biological drugs for UC.

Secondly, she has a background of congestive cardiac failure. This is an important factor to consider as some drugs might have cardiovascular side effects.

Based on the information given, two potential choices of biological drugs could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.
   - Disadvantages: It is administered via intravenous infusion, which might be inconvenient. Also, the patient might experience common side effects like headache, joint pain, nausea or fever.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe UC. It is administered subcutaneously, which might be more convenient than intravenous infusion.
   - Disadvantages: Potential side effects include respiratory infections, fatigue, headache, and skin rash. It's also important to monitor for any signs of cardiac failure exacerbation.

It's crucial to have a detailed discussion with the patient about the pros and cons of each treatment option, considering her personal preferences, lifestyle, and overall health status.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.
We refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the
American College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn’s and
Colitis

Risk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication
at Diagnosis
Appropriately
risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Human: question
Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

Firstly, the patient is newly diagnosed with moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). This means she has not been previously treated with any biological drugs for UC.

Secondly, she also has psoriasis, an extraintestinal manifestation. This could influence the choice of treatment as some drugs might be more effective in managing both conditions.

From the reference text, Ustekinumab (UST) is suggested as a treatment option for patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis (Source: agrawal.pdf). Ustekinumab is also mentioned in the Burr et al. study as a drug that has shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials for moderate to severely active UC (Source: gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf).

Another potential choice could be TNF inhibitors (TNFi), such as Infliximab or Adalimumab. These are commonly used in the treatment of moderate to severe UC and have also been shown to be effective in treating psoriasis (Source: gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf).

Let's consider these two as top choices:

1. Ustekinumab
   - Advantages: It can treat both UC and psoriasis, reducing the number of medications the patient needs to take. It has shown efficacy in clinical trials.
   - Disadvantages: As a relatively new drug, long-term safety data might be limited compared to older, more established treatments.

2. TNF inhibitors (Infliximab or Adalimumab)
   - Advantages: These are well-established treatments with known efficacy for both UC and psoriasis. There is extensive experience and data regarding their use.
   - Disadvantages: They may have potential side effects including increased risk of infections. Regular monitoring is required.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Efficacy and Safety of Advanced Therapies
incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving.
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF],
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED]
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the
Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which
tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are
currently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-
verely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-
tolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi’s.4–7 All orally
administered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their
JAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and
UPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1
over JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-
erentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-
tional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs
of JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-
tively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P),
is also approved for use in UC.10
With this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid
toward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of
development for moderately to severely active UC. Most
recently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and
published a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist
network meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of
biologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely
UC. Both studies assessed all outcomes after induction (6–14
weeks); Lasa et al11 additionally assessed efficacy after main-
tenance (26–66 weeks) separately for treat-through (TT) and","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

In the last 10 years small molecules, which can be administered orally and on a daily
basis, have also been evaluated in moderate to severe UC. These include janus kinase
inhibitors, such as tofacitinib,[20] and the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator,
ozanimod.[21] The comparative efficacy and safety of all these drugs has been assessed in
prior network meta-analyses.[22, 23] These demonstrated that infliximab was ranked highest
overall for efficacy, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with
previous anti-TNF-α exposure. However, this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already
several newer drugs that have shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not
considered in these network meta-analyses.[24-26] We have therefore performed an updated
network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of all biological therapies and small molecules
that have progressed on to phase III trials, compared with each other or with placebo, in terms
of induction of remission, endoscopic improvement, and clinical response, as well as safety,
in patients with moderate to severely active UC.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

DISCUSSION
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d.
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo, although etrolizumab 105mg was more
likely to lead to serious adverse events than golimumab 200/100mg, ustekinumab 6mg/kg,
vedolizumab 300mg, and infliximab 5mg/kg. Vedolizumab 300mg was the least likely drug
to lead to infections. Infections were significantly more likely with tofacitinib 10mg b.i.d.
than with either placebo or vedolizumab 300mg. Finally, withdrawals due to adverse events
were significantly less likely with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. than with placebo. Upadacitinib
45mg o.d. was significantly less likely to lead to withdrawals due to an adverse event than
infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg, vedolizumab 300mg, adalimumab 160/80mg or 80/40mg,
filgotinib 200mg o.d., and etrolizumab 105mg. Applying GRADE criteria to our estimates of
effects, certainty in the quality of evidence would be high.
There are some limitations. Only nine of 27 trials were at low risk of bias across all
domains. Given the timespan of included studies, there is the possibility that trials of newer
drugs included patients with refractory UC who had failed multiple other therapies. However,
some of these more recent trials only recruited patients who were naïve to anti-TNF-α","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis
Juan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet
Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and
waning, but the underlying systemic inﬂammation can lead
to progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinal
damage

Complications
associated
with

inﬂammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, ﬁstulas,
abscesses, and surgery,3,16 and those associated with UC
include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and
colorectal cancer.2,4,17 Other complications include anemia,
nutritional deﬁciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-
sive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inﬂamma-
tion

eases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-
tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be
measured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.19
Limited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,
Symptoms, and Complications
The concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and
symptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a
population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-
mation may precede formal diagnosis.22 The STRIDE

ease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant to

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.
We refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the
American College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn’s and
Colitis
Organization,
and
British
Society
of
Gastro-
enterology.37–40
Risk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication
at Diagnosis
Appropriately
risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient."

Human: question
Let's think step by step.","First, we need to consider the patient's age and the severity of his ulcerative colitis (UC). He is 56 years old and has moderate to severe UC.

Second, we need to consider his extraintestinal manifestation, which is ankylosing spondylitis. This is a type of arthritis that affects the spine, and it's important to choose a treatment that can address both conditions.

Based on the information given, two top choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Infliximab and Adalimumab.

Infliximab is a drug that targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in moderate to severe UC. It also has been shown to be effective in treating ankylosing spondylitis.

Adalimumab is another drug against TNF-α that has been tested for UC. It is also approved for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

Infliximab:
- Advantages: It has been shown to be effective in treating both UC and ankylosing spondylitis. It may lead to remission in some patients.
- Disadvantages: It is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. There may be risks associated with its use, such as serious infections and lymphoma.

Adalimumab:
- Advantages: It is also effective in treating both conditions. It is administered via subcutaneous injection, which some patients may find more convenient than intravenous administration.
- Disadvantages: It also carries risks such as serious infections and lymphoma. Some patients may not respond to the treatment.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis
Juan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet
Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

being increasingly recognized that frailty, rather than

Other Demographic Variables
There are signiﬁcant differences in IBD phenotype

a multitude of factors, both social and biologic. Emer-

and
IBD-related

Asian immigrants living in the United Kingdom were

compared with their native counterparts,53 which might
be related, in part, to limited access to care.54 Genes
implicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared
with White patients with IBD.55 Being aware of the
higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's profile:
- The patient is 38 years old, which means age-related risks for certain treatments are less of a concern.
- The patient has severe ulcerative colitis, which means we need to consider potent treatments.
- The patient has lost response to Vedolizumab, which means we need to consider other classes of drugs.

Based on the reference texts, two potential choices could be Infliximab and Ustekinumab.

Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor and has shown efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. However, it's important to note that some patients may develop resistance or intolerance to TNF-alpha inhibitors over time.

Ustekinumab, on the other hand, is an interleukin inhibitor and could be a good option for patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy. It has been ranked highly for inducing clinical remission in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Here are the top 2 choices:

1. Infliximab
   - Advantages: Proven efficacy in treating moderate to severe UC, can lead to clinical remission and endoscopic improvement.
   - Disadvantages: Risk of developing resistance or intolerance over time, potential for serious infections.

2. Ustekinumab
   - Advantages: Good option for patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy, has been ranked highly for inducing clinical remission.
   - Disadvantages: Less long-term data available compared to Infliximab, potential for serious infections.

Please note that the final decision should be made in consultation with the patient, taking into account the potential benefits and risks of each treatment option, as well as the patient's preferences and lifestyle.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially
disabling condition that is clinically characterised
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission,
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,
namely vedolizumab and, more recently, usteki numab.
However,

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

“safety” OR “adverse events”]. Additionally, experts in the
field were contacted for any unpublished data.
We included phase 3 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria:
(1) studies including adult (≥18 years) patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (defined as a Mayo
Score of 6–12, with an endoscopic sub-score of 2–3) who
were either biologic-naive or had previously been exposed
to at least one biologic; (2) studies either evaluating the
following biologics and small molecule drugs in their
approved dose regimens, infliximab (intravenous or
subcutaneous), adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab
(intravenous or sub cutaneous), ustekinumab (intravenous
or subcutaneous), tofacitinib, or ozanimod, or studies
evaluating etroli zumab, upadacitinib, filgotinib, etrasimod,
or TD-1473; (3) studies including an active comparator or
placebo; and (4) studies assessing the following outcomes:
clinical remission (defined as a Mayo score of ≤2, with no
individual sub-score >1) and endoscopic improvement
(Mayo endoscopic sub-score 0–1). We did not include
phase 2 trials because treatment effects can be over-
estimated or underestimated due to the intrinsically small
sample sizes of these studies. Additionally, given the dose-
ranging nature of phase 2 trials, many of them include
doses that will not be further explored in phase 3 trials.
For approved agents, only approved doses were
included in our analyses (intravenous infliximab:
5 mg/kg in weeks 0, 2, and 6 in induction, and 5 mg/kg
every 8 weeks in maintenance; subcutaneous infliximab:
120 mg every 2 weeks in maintenance; subcutaneous
adalimumab: 160 mg in week 0, 80 mg in week 2, and
40 mg in week 4 in induction, and 40 mg every other
week in maintenance; subcutaneous golimumab: 200 mg
in week 0 and 100 mg in week 2 in induction, and 100 mg
every 4 weeks in maintenance; intravenous vedolizumab:
300 mg in weeks 0, 2, and 6 in induction, and
300 mg every 8 weeks in maintenance; subcutaneous
vedolizumab: 108 mg every 2 weeks in maintenance;
ustekinumab: 6 mg/kg intravenously in week 0 in
induction, and 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks in
maintenance; oral tofacitinib: 10 mg twice daily for
8 weeks in induction, and 5 mg twice daily in
maintenance; and oral ozanimod: 1 mg daily in induction
and maintenance). For non-approved agents in a late

Firstly, the patient has severe extensive ulcerative colitis. This indicates that she may require more potent treatments such as biologics or small molecule drugs.

Secondly, the patient has a history of lymphoma which was treated 4 years ago. This is important to consider as some treatments for ulcerative colitis can potentially increase the risk of certain cancers, including lymphoma.

Given these considerations, two potential treatment options could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and is less likely to have systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. However, it is administered intravenously which may be inconvenient for some patients.

Ustekinumab is another biologic that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It targets a specific protein involved in inflammation, potentially leading to fewer side effects. However, it is also administered via injection, which may be a disadvantage for some patients.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

text: Combination therapy of a biologic with IMM, best-
studied with TNFi, is an important consideration in severe
disease, especially penetrating or perianal disease. It is
associated with improved outcomes, a decrease in loss of
TNFi response, and fewer long-term complications.90,91 The
mechanism of action may be due to decrease in immuno-
genicity and impact on drug level. Similar effects have not
been seen with adding IMM to UST of VDZ therapy, possibly
due to a lower role of immunogenicity in drug meta-
bolism.92 For patients with perianal CD, a multidisciplinary
approach with early referral to a colorectal surgeon is key to
improved outcomes.93
Ileocolic resection as a ﬁrst-line therapy. Surgery
is often viewed as a late-stage therapeutic option for CD, to
be positioned after medical therapies, and the rate of sur-
gery for CD has declined over time.94 The LIR!C (Laparo-

found no difference in safety or measures of quality of life at
1 year between the 2 groups.95 Furthermore, on long-term
follow-up (median 5 years), the ICR group had no subse-
quent resection, 42% received no treatment at all, and 74%

initial treatment modality not only in patients presenting
with a complication at diagnosis, but also in those with

decision-making or when concerns about biologic safety are
a signiﬁcant consideration.
Dietary therapy. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is
the use of polymeric or elemental formula typically for 8–12
weeks to induce remission in CD. European Pediatric
Consensus guidelines recommend EEN as the ﬁrst-line
therapy to induce remission in pediatric patients with

controlled trials demonstrating that EEN is as effective as
corticosteroids.

Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

Firstly, the patient is a 36-year-old woman with moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). She also has multiple sclerosis, which is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease.

Given her age, she is not in the high-risk category for adverse outcomes related to age. However, her co-existing condition of multiple sclerosis may influence the choice of treatment for her UC.

The presence of a concomitant immune-mediated inflammatory disease like multiple sclerosis can influence the choice of treatment for UC. Certain drugs used in the treatment of UC may have implications for her multiple sclerosis.

Based on the reference text, the first-line treatment options for moderate UC include 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and biological therapies such as TNF-α inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab), integrin receptor antagonists (vedolizumab), and interleukin inhibitors (ustekinumab).

However, considering her multiple sclerosis, TNF-α inhibitors might not be the best choice as they have been associated with the induction of demyelinating diseases.

Therefore, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be:

1. Vedolizumab: This drug targets α4β7 integrin and selectively inhibits gut inflammation. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.

2. Ustekinumab: This drug targets interleukin-12 and -23, important cytokines in the pathogenesis of UC. It has also been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC.

Let's analyze the pros and cons of these two choices:

Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: It has a gut-selective mechanism of action, which might result in fewer systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in UC.
- Disadvantages: It is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. There may be risks associated with its use, such as an increased risk of infections.

Ustekinumab:
- Advantages: It can be administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for some patients. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in UC.
- Disadvantages: Potential side effects include upper respiratory infections, headache, and fatigue.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis
Juan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet
Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

being increasingly recognized that frailty, rather than
chronologic age, may be the driver of adverse outcomes in
this group.49,50
Other Demographic Variables
There are signiﬁcant differences in IBD phenotype
and outcomes based on race and ethnicity, likely due to
a multitude of factors, both social and biologic. Emer-
gency department use, hospitalization, complicated dis-
ease
course,
and
IBD-related
disability
are
more
common in minority and lower socioeconomic status
groups.51,52 In a study of 770 patients with IBD, South
Asian immigrants living in the United Kingdom were
more
likely
to
have
extensive
UC
and
colonic
CD
compared with their native counterparts,53 which might
be related, in part, to limited access to care.54 Genes
implicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared
with White patients with IBD.55 Being aware of the
higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

Human: question
Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's age. At 39 years old, the patient is relatively young and should be able to tolerate most treatments for ulcerative colitis.

Second, the patient has moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis. This indicates that the disease is widespread and severe, requiring potent treatment.

Third, the patient has a history of malignant melanoma which was treated 3 years ago. This is important because some treatments for ulcerative colitis, particularly those that modulate the immune system, can increase the risk of certain types of cancer.

Given these considerations, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take several weeks to start working. It's also administered via intravenous infusion, which can be inconvenient.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is also effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It's administered via subcutaneous injection, which some patients might find more convenient than an infusion.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab can increase the risk of infections. Given the patient's history of cancer, there may also be a slightly increased risk of certain types of cancer.

It's important to discuss these options with the patient, taking into account his preferences and lifestyle. The final decision should be made in collaboration with the patient and his healthcare team.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis
Juan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet
Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Given the patient's successful induction with vedolizumab, the maintenance therapy would typically continue with the same medication. Vedolizumab is usually administered as an intravenous infusion at zero, two, and six weeks for induction, and then every eight weeks for maintenance.

However, the specific maintenance therapy can depend on various factors such as the patient's overall health, response to the medication, and any side effects experienced. It's important to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

In this case, the top choice for maintenance therapy would be:

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: This medication has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, especially those who have responded well to induction therapy with vedolizumab. It is also generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion, which can be less convenient for some patients. Potential side effects include headache, joint pain, nausea, and infections.

Please note that the final decision should be made in consultation with the patient and based on a comprehensive assessment of her condition.",,,,,,,"title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global

Background:  Given rapid innovation in advanced therapies for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), we investigated their com-
parative efficacy and safety during induction and maintenance through network meta-analysis.
Methods:  Using Bayesian methods, endpoints of clinical remission and clinical response per Full Mayo score, and endoscopic improvement
were assessed in bio-naive and -exposed populations. Safety was assessed in overall populations by all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs,
discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Studies
included
in
these
meta-
analyses were phase II or III randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) that met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) patients: adults (age, >18 y) with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic score of 6–12,
with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3) who were
either
treatment-naïve
(ﬁrst-line)
or
previously
exposed to TNFa antagonists (second-line); (2) inter-
vention: biologic therapy with inﬂiximab, adalimumab,
golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab,
with a minimum duration of therapy of 14 days; (3)
comparator: another active intervention or placebo;
and (4) outcome: induction of clinical remission (Mayo
Clinic score of �2 with no individual subscore of >1)
and endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy sub-
score of 0 or 1).
Because trials of maintenance therapy of biologic
agents had different designs (treat straight-through
design vs rerandomizing responders to induction ther-
apy), we conducted separate pairwise and network
meta-analyses for these different trial designs. Because
safety is unlikely to be inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by main-
tenance therapy trial design, to inform comparative
safety, we conducted a single network meta-analysis of
all trials of maintenance therapy, regardless of different
trial design. Detailed inclusion criteria for trials of
maintenance therapy and exclusion criteria are listed in
the Supplementary Appendix.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.

text: comparative analysis of maintenance trials has suggested
higher safety with vedolizumab, rates of important
events such as serious infections was low and other
serious events such as malignancy could not be evalu-
ated thoroughly. Moreover, differences in study design of
maintenance therapy (treat straight-through vs reran-
domization of responders), as well as lack of information
on safety stratiﬁed by prior TNFa antagonist exposure
status, potentially may bias safety results. Postmarketing
surveillance studies of these different agents may better
inform the relative safety of these agents. Safety of
tofacitinib seems to be dose-dependent, and in instances
in which a higher 10-mg twice-per-day dose of tofacitinib
is used for long-term maintenance, safety concerns
should be discussed adequately with patients.
Integrating ﬁndings from this meta-analysis and other
studies, current evidence favors inﬂiximab or vedolizu-
mab
as
the
preferred
ﬁrst-line
agents
for
moderate–severe ulcerative colitis. In patients who fail
inﬂiximab, ustekinumab and tofacitinib likely would be
most efﬁcacious, and ustekinumab’s superior safety
proﬁle may be attractive in light of recent concerns
around
venous
thromboembolism
with
tofacitinib.
However, besides quality of evidence, several other fac-
tors including a balance of risk–beneﬁt proﬁle, speciﬁc
patient attributes (age, comorbid conditions including
rheumatic or dermatologic diseases, and so forth), clin-
ical judgment and experience of the treating physicians,
values
and
preferences
of
patients
(dosing
route,
regimen, acceptability of risk–beneﬁt trade-offs, and so
forth), as well as the costs/resources available, are
important to facilitate shared decision making, in devel-
oping a personalized treatment strategy for each patient,
and shape health care policy on positioning different
agents. Pragmatic head-to-head trials in both biologic-
naïve and biologic-exposed patients are warranted to
optimally inform the relative positioning of newly
available agents in clinical practice.

Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

This patient has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and was previously in remission with infliximab, but has now developed a loss of response due to antibody formation. This suggests that the patient has become resistant to infliximab, which is an anti-TNF agent.

From the reference text, we know that upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first for clinical remission in all patients, patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs, and patients previously exposed. This suggests that upadacitinib could be a good option for this patient.

Another option could be ustekinumab, which has been suggested as a treatment for patients with substantial comorbidities or contraindications to TNF antagonists. However, this patient does not appear to have substantial comorbidities or contraindications, so this may not be the best choice.

Therefore, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be:

1. Upadacitinib: This drug has been shown to be effective in inducing clinical remission in patients who have been previously exposed to anti-TNF-α drugs. However, it was more likely to lead to adverse events, although serious adverse events were no more frequent, and withdrawals due to adverse events were significantly lower than with placebo.

2. Ustekinumab: This drug could be an alternative option, especially if the patient has other comorbidities or contraindications to TNF antagonists. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient as he does not appear to have substantial comorbidities or contraindications.

Here is the information in the requested format:

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate
response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-
numab, 13% to 18% patients had prior exposure to both
vedolizumab and TNFa antagonists. These data were not
available for tofacitinib.

direct
meta-
analysis, tofacitinib and ustekinumab, but not adalimu-
mab or vedolizumab, were superior to placebo for induc-
tion of clinical remission (Supplementary Figure 3A), with
minimal heterogeneity across estimates (I2 < 30%). On
network meta-analysis, there was moderate conﬁdence in
estimates supporting the use of tofacitinib (OR, 11.88;
95% CI, 2.32–60.89) and ustekinumab (OR, 11.51; 95% CI,
2.65–49.96), and low conﬁdence in estimates supporting
the use of vedolizumab (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.87–4.25) over
placebo, for induction of clinical remission in patients with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Table 3). On com-
parison of active interventions, there was moderate con-
ﬁdence in estimates supporting the use of tofacitinib and
ustekinumab over adalimumab (tofacitinib vs adalimu-
mab: OR, 11.05; 95% CI, 1.79–68.41; ustekinumab vs
adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20), and over
vedolizumab (tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95%
CI, 1.00–38.00; ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76) for induction of clinical remission in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists. Overall,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87)
were ranked highest for inducing clinical remission in
patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.

treatment efﬁcacy with an anti-integrin biologic (Singh et al., 2018c).
First and second line agent treatment sequences and treatment response
have been presented in the previous chapter. However, data are even
scarcer concerning third line of treatment after two anti-TNFs exposure.
A retrospective small series of 67 patients with Crohn's disease treated
with 3rd line anti-TNF agent (Allez et al., 2010) reported a lower
response rate and the lack of late responders at 6 months. A recent
multicenter retrospective study reported the outcome of patients with
late CD who had failed treatment with one anti-TNF agent and either
vedolizumab or ustekinumab. After 48 weeks on a third line of biologic
therapy the remission rate was 30.7% whereas the surgery rate was
23.5% (Kassouri et al., 2020).
There is a mechanistic role for anti-IL 23 agents in TNF refractory IBD
patients. During anti TNF treatment, in non-responders compared to re-
sponders, there is upregulation of apoptosis resistant IL23p19, IL23R,
and IL17 A as demonstrated by studies using immunophenotyping of T
cells. (Bek et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2019). This phenomenon suggests
that ustekinumab (as IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor) and other IL-23 inhibitor
agents may have a mechanistic potential in late CD (Eftychi et al., 2019)
when an expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells (Veny et al., 2010) may have
occurred.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked
according to their P-score.
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,
P-score 0.98), with infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg second and third, respectively.
Upadacitinib ranked first for clinical remission in both patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs
(RR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.61-0.78, P-score 0.99) and previously exposed (RR = 0.78; 95% CI
0.72-0.85, P-score 0.99). Upadacitinib was superior to almost all other drugs in these
analyses. Based on failure to achieve endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked
first (RR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.51-0.72, P-score 0.97), with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. second, and
infliximab 5mg/kg third. Upadacitinib was more likely to lead to adverse events, but serious
adverse events were no more frequent, and withdrawals due to adverse events were
significantly lower than with placebo. Infections were significantly more likely with
tofacitinib than placebo (RR = 1.41; 95% CI 1.03-1.91).
Conclusion: In a network meta-analysis, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first for clinical
remission in all patients, patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs, and patients previously exposed."

Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's age, which is 44 years old. This is within the typical age range for treatment with biological drugs for ulcerative colitis (UC).

Second, the patient has moderate to severe extensive UC. This indicates that she may need more potent treatment options, such as biological drugs or small molecule inhibitors.

Third, the patient also has rheumatoid arthritis. Some biological drugs used for UC treatment also have efficacy in treating rheumatoid arthritis, which could be beneficial in this case.

Given this information, two top choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Infliximab and Adalimumab. Both of these drugs are anti-TNF agents, which have been shown to be effective in treating both UC and rheumatoid arthritis.

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. It is also beneficial for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. There may also be risks of serious infections and potential drug reactions.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is also effective in treating both UC and rheumatoid arthritis. It is administered subcutaneously, which some patients may find more convenient than intravenous administration.
   - Disadvantages: Some patients may not respond to Adalimumab or may lose response over time. There is also a risk of serious infections.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small

We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.

Let’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.

Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.

We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.

Officer Mora was 27 years old.

First, we need to consider the patient's age, disease severity, and preference for convenience and limited hospital time.

From the provided documents, we know that several drugs have been tested for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and upadacitinib.

In terms of efficacy, upadacitinib 45mg once daily ranked first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.

However, for endoscopic improvement, infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by upadacitinib 45mg once daily, and infliximab 5mg/kg.

In terms of safety, none of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than placebo.

Given the patient's preference for convenience and limited hospital time, a drug that can be administered orally, such as upadacitinib, might be a good choice.

However, the choice of treatment should also consider the patient's overall health status, potential side effects, and the cost of the medication.

Based on the information provided, the top two choices could be:

1. Upadacitinib: This drug has shown high efficacy in inducing clinical remission and response in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is taken orally, which may be more convenient for the patient. However, the potential side effects and cost should be considered.

2. Infliximab: This drug has shown high efficacy in inducing endoscopic improvement. However, it is administered intravenously, which may require more hospital visits.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

Risk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication

Appropriately
risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs

and

compared with their native counterparts,53 which might
be related, in part, to limited access to care.54 Genes
implicated in IBD risk also differ in non-White compared
with White patients with IBD.55 Being aware of the
higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution.

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.

Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

He met the Ukrainian people.

From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.

We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.

Officer Mora was 27 years old.

Officer Rivera was 22.

Both Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Human: question
Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's age and prior treatment history. The patient is 60 years old and has had a loss of response to anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab.

From the reference text, we know that upadacitinib and tofacitinib are ranked highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists for induction of remission and endoscopic improvement. However, the patient has also had a loss of response to vedolizumab and ustekinumab, which might limit the effectiveness of these drugs.

Given the patient's age, we also need to consider the safety profile of the drugs. The text mentions that golimumab had higher odds versus placebo for all adverse events during maintenance, while upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo for discontinuation due to adverse events during induction.

Based on this information, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be upadacitinib and tofacitinib.

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

1. Upadacitinib
   - Advantages: High efficacy rates in inducing remission and endoscopic improvement, lower odds for discontinuation due to adverse events during induction.
   - Disadvantages: The safety profile in older patients is not specifically mentioned, and the patient's response given her prior treatment history is uncertain.

2. Tofacitinib
   - Advantages: High efficacy rates in inducing remission and endoscopic improvement.
   - Disadvantages: The safety profile in older patients is not specifically mentioned, and the patient's response given her prior treatment history is uncertain.

Please note that the final decision should be made in consultation with the patient, taking into account her preferences, lifestyle, and overall health status.

Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's age and the severity of his ulcerative colitis. He is 36 years old and has moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis. This suggests that he may need a more aggressive treatment approach.

Second, we need to consider his spondylarthristis. This is an extraintestinal manifestation of ulcerative colitis, which means that the inflammation is not just limited to his gut. This can complicate treatment and may require a medication that can address both conditions.

Given these factors, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Infliximab and Adalimumab.

Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and spondylarthristis. It is usually administered intravenously.

Adalimumab is another TNF-alpha inhibitor that can be used to treat both conditions. It is administered through subcutaneous injections.

Here are the pros and cons of these two drugs:

Infliximab:
- Advantages: It has a rapid onset of action and can induce and maintain remission in many patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can also treat extraintestinal manifestations like spondylarthristis.
- Disadvantages: It requires intravenous administration, which can be inconvenient. It can also cause serious side effects, including infections, heart failure, and a potential increased risk of lymphoma.

Adalimumab:
- Advantages: It can be administered at home through subcutaneous injections. It is also effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and spondylarthristis.
- Disadvantages: It may take longer to work compared to infliximab. It can also cause side effects, including infections, heart failure, and a potential increased risk of lymphoma.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis
Juan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet
Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were"

Human: question
Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's current condition and treatment. The patient is a 42-year-old woman with moderate ulcerative colitis who is currently on azathioprine and not responding to therapy.

Given the patient's lack of response to azathioprine, a type of immunomodulator, we should consider escalating her treatment to a biological therapy.

From the reference text, we know that several biological therapies have been tested for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and ustekinumab.

Infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are anti-TNF agents, while vedolizumab targets α or β integrins, tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor, and ustekinumab targets interleukin-12 and -23.

According to the network meta-analysis results, infliximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission in biologic-naïve patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. However, in patients with prior exposure to anti-TNF-α therapies, ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest for induction of clinical remission.

Since the patient has not been previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, infliximab could be a good option. However, we should also consider the patient's age, potential side effects, and personal preferences.

Based on this analysis, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be infliximab and adalimumab.

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

Infliximab:
- Advantages: High efficacy in inducing clinical remission in biologic-naïve patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
- Disadvantages: Potential side effects include infections, infusion reactions, and the development of antibodies to the drug.

Adalimumab:
- Advantages: Can be administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for some patients.
- Disadvantages: May be less effective than infliximab in inducing clinical remission in biologic-naïve patients.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Officer Mora was 27 years old.

Officer Rivera was 22.

Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's age. At 53 years old, the patient is not elderly, but we should still consider the potential side effects and risks of biological drugs, especially those that might be more common in older adults.

Second, the patient has moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis. This indicates that the disease is widespread and severe, which may require more potent treatment.

Third, the patient has low albumin levels. Low albumin levels can be a sign of malnutrition or inflammation, both of which are common in people with ulcerative colitis. This could potentially affect the patient's ability to tolerate certain treatments.

Given these factors, two potential choices of biological drugs could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can help reduce inflammation and achieve remission. However, it can also have side effects such as increased risk of infection and potential for infusion reactions.

Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin receptor antagonist. It works by blocking the migration of white blood cells into the inflamed gut tissue, thus reducing inflammation. It may be a good choice for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate TNF-alpha inhibitors. However, it may take longer to work than TNF-alpha inhibitors and can also increase the risk of infection.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

Human: question
Let's think step by step.","Given the patient's profile, we need to consider her age, the severity of her ulcerative colitis, and the presence of a rare fistulating disease.

The first-line treatment for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis often includes anti-TNF agents like Infliximab or Adalimumab. However, the presence of a fistulating disease may complicate the treatment approach as some medications might not be as effective in treating this condition.

Based on the available information, two potential choices of biological drugs could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has shown efficacy in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can also be effective in treating fistulating diseases, which is a significant consideration for this patient.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which might be inconvenient for some patients. There's also a risk of developing serious infections and potential adverse effects like headaches, rash, or nausea.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets the gut and can be effective in treating ulcerative colitis. It's generally well-tolerated with a lower risk of systemic side effects.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab might not be as effective in treating fistulating diseases. It's also administered intravenously, and some patients might experience side effects like headache, joint pain, nausea, or fever.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health, lifestyle, and personal preferences. It's also crucial to monitor the patient's response to the treatment and adjust the approach as necessary.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis
Juan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet
Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

text: perianal CD varied between 11% and 19% at 1–10 years
after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and
waning, but the underlying systemic inﬂammation can lead
to progressive, cumulative, and often irreversible intestinal
damage
and
risk
of
complications
if
not
treated
adequately.15
Complications
associated
with
ongoing
inﬂammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, ﬁstulas,
abscesses, and surgery,3,16 and those associated with UC
include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and
colorectal cancer.2,4,17 Other complications include anemia,
nutritional deﬁciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-
sive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inﬂamma-
tion
is
associated
with
growth
impairment,
risking
permanent loss of height.18 Similar to other chronic dis-
eases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-
tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be
measured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.19
Limited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,
Symptoms, and Complications
The concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and
symptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a
population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-
mation may precede formal diagnosis.22 The STRIDE

ease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant to
target endoscopic healing, minimize disability, and restore
quality of life and adequate growth in children, in addition","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Human: question
Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's age and medical history. The patient is 68 years old and has a history of prostate cancer, which was treated 5 years ago. This could potentially affect the choice of treatment for his ulcerative colitis, as some medications might have interactions with cancer treatments or could potentially increase the risk of cancer recurrence.

Second, the patient has extensive moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. This indicates that the disease is widespread and severe, which might require more aggressive treatment.

Given the patient's age and history of cancer, it would be important to choose a treatment that is effective for ulcerative colitis but also has a low risk of serious side effects and does not increase the risk of cancer recurrence.

Based on the reference text, two potential choices could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. However, it has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and potential malignancy.

Vedolizumab is a newer biological therapy that targets alpha4-beta7 integrin and is involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and may have a better safety profile compared to TNF-alpha inhibitors.

Here are the top 2 choices:

1. Infliximab
   - Advantages: Proven efficacy in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: Risk of serious infections and potential malignancy.

2. Vedolizumab
   - Advantages: Effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, potentially better safety profile compared to TNF-alpha inhibitors.
   - Disadvantages: As a newer drug, long-term effects are not as well-known.

Please note that the final decision should be made in consultation with the patient's healthcare provider, taking into account the patient's overall health, preferences, and potential drug interactions.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Firstly, the patient is a young adult with extensive moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). This indicates that the disease is widespread and severe, requiring potent treatment options.

Secondly, the patient also has primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with decompensated cirrhosis. This is a serious liver condition that can complicate the management of UC. Some medications used for UC might not be suitable due to their potential liver toxicity.

Given these considerations, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe UC. It is also less likely to cause liver toxicity, making it suitable for patients with liver conditions.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may not work for everyone and it can take several weeks to see an effect. It is administered via intravenous infusion, which may be inconvenient for some patients. There is also a risk of infusion reactions and infections.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is another option for moderate to severe UC. It works by inhibiting interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, which are involved in the inflammatory process. It is administered subcutaneously, which some patients may find more convenient.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may also take several weeks to work. Side effects can include respiratory infections, headache, and fatigue. The effect of Ustekinumab on liver disease is not well-studied, so close monitoring would be necessary.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized and discussed thoroughly with the patient, taking into account the potential benefits and risks, as well as the patient's preferences and values.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Inﬂammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn’s
disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic, progressive,
immune-mediated diseases of adults and children that
have no cure. IBD can cause signiﬁcant morbidity and lead
to complications such as strictures, ﬁstulas, infections, and
cancer.
In
children,
IBD
can
also
result
in
growth
impairment and pubertal delays. IBD is highly heteroge-
nous, with severity ranging from mild to severe and
symptoms ranging from mild to debilitating. Delay in IBD
diagnosis, especially in Crohn’s disease, is common and
associated with adverse outcomes. Early diagnosis and
prompt institution of treatment are the cornerstones for
improving outcomes and maximizing health. Early diag-
nosis requires a low threshold of suspicion and red ﬂags to
guide early specialist referral at the primary provider
level. Although the armamentarium of IBD medications is
growing, many patients will not respond to treatment, and
the selection of ﬁrst-line therapy is critical. Risk stratiﬁ-
cation of disease severity, based on clinical, demographic,
and serologic markers, can help guide selection of ﬁrst-line
therapy. Clinical decision support tools, genomics, and
other biomarkers of response to therapy and risk of
adverse events are the future of personalized medicine.
After starting appropriate therapy, it is important to
conﬁrm remission using objective end points (treat to
target) with continued control of inﬂammation with
adjustment of therapy using surrogate biomarkers (tight
control). Lastly, IBD therapy extends far beyond medica-
tions, and other aspects of the overall health and wellbeing
of the patient are critical. These include preventive health,
nutrition, and psychobehavioral support addressing pa-
tients’
concerns
around
complementary
therapy
and
medication
adherence,
prevention
of
disability,
and
ensuring open communication.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

First, we need to consider the patient's age and disease severity. She is 48 years old and has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Second, we need to consider the patient's treatment preference. She prioritizes a rapid response to treatment.

Based on the reference texts, two top choices of biological drugs for this patient could be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

Infliximab is a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in moderate to severe UC.

Vedolizumab is a newer biological therapy targeting α or β integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa.

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

Infliximab:
- Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. It has a rapid onset of action, which aligns with the patient's preference.
- Disadvantages: Infliximab can have side effects including risk of serious infections. It is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: Vedolizumab is also effective in treating moderate to severe UC. It specifically targets the gut, potentially leading to fewer systemic side effects.
- Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may take longer to work compared to TNF-α inhibitors like Infliximab. It is also administered intravenously.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.

Risk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication

Appropriately
risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small

Human: question
Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's profile:
- She is a 36-year-old woman with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
- She has lost response to tofacitinib, which is a Janus kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

Based on the reference texts, we can consider the following options:

1. Ustekinumab: This is a monoclonal antibody that targets the p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23. It has been shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to, lost response to, or were intolerant to TNF blockers or immunomodulators.

2. Vedolizumab: This is a monoclonal antibody that targets α4β7 integrin and selectively blocks gut lymphocyte trafficking. It has been shown to be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to, lost response to, or were intolerant to TNF blockers or immunomodulators.

Let's analyze the pros and cons of these two options:

Ustekinumab:
- Advantages: It has a different mechanism of action from TNF blockers and tofacitinib, which might be beneficial in a patient who has lost response to tofacitinib. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
- Disadvantages: It requires subcutaneous injections, which some patients might find inconvenient. There is a risk of infections and other side effects, although it is generally well-tolerated.

Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: It has a different mechanism of action from TNF blockers and tofacitinib, which might be beneficial in a patient who has lost response to tofacitinib. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
- Disadvantages: It requires intravenous infusions, which some patients might find inconvenient. There is a risk of infections and other side effects, although it is generally well-tolerated.

Based on this analysis, the top two choices for this patient would be Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab.

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked
according to their P-score.
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,
P-score 0.98), with infliximab 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg second and third, respectively.
Upadacitinib ranked first for clinical remission in both patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs
(RR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.61-0.78, P-score 0.99) and previously exposed (RR = 0.78; 95% CI
0.72-0.85, P-score 0.99). Upadacitinib was superior to almost all other drugs in these
analyses. Based on failure to achieve endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked
first (RR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.51-0.72, P-score 0.97), with upadacitinib 45mg o.d. second, and
infliximab 5mg/kg third. Upadacitinib was more likely to lead to adverse events, but serious
adverse events were no more frequent, and withdrawals due to adverse events were
significantly lower than with placebo. Infections were significantly more likely with
tofacitinib than placebo (RR = 1.41; 95% CI 1.03-1.91).
Conclusion: In a network meta-analysis, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first for clinical
remission in all patients, patients naïve to anti-TNF-α drugs, and patients previously exposed.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

There were no trials of inﬂiximab or golimumab in
patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists who
met inclusion criteria. In trials of adalimumab, only pa-
tients with loss of response or intolerance to a prior
TNFa antagonist were included. In contrast, in trials of
vedolizumab, 48% to 58% of patients had inadequate
response to a TNFa antagonist, and in trials of usteki-

parison of active interventions, there was moderate con-
ﬁdence in estimates supporting the use of tofacitinib and
ustekinumab over adalimumab (tofacitinib vs adalimu-

patients with prior exposure to TNFa antagonists. Overall,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87)
were ranked highest for inducing clinical remission in
patients with moderate–severe ulcerative colitis with
prior exposure to TNFa antagonists (Figure 2B). With an
estimated placebo rate of achieving clinical remission of
3% in included trials, we estimated that 3.2%, 5.6%,
26.9%, and 26.3% of adalimumab-, vedolizumab-, tofaci-
tinib-, and ustekinumab-treated patients, respectively,
would achieve induction of remission.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Positioning therapies for the management of inflammatory bowel disease

First, we need to consider the patient's age and disease severity. The patient is 18 years old and has moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis. This indicates that the disease is widespread and severe, which may require more aggressive treatment.

Second, the patient also has pyoderma gangrenosum, an extraintestinal manifestation of ulcerative colitis. This further complicates the patient's condition and may influence the choice of treatment.

Given these factors, the patient may benefit from biological therapies that can address both the ulcerative colitis and the pyoderma gangrenosum.

Based on the reference texts, two potential choices could be Infliximab and Adalimumab.

Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It can also be effective in treating pyoderma gangrenosum. However, it is administered intravenously which may be inconvenient for some patients.

Adalimumab is another TNF-alpha inhibitor that can be used in the treatment of moderate to severe UC and may also be effective for pyoderma gangrenosum. It is administered subcutaneously, which some patients may find more convenient than intravenous administration. However, it may not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use.

Here are the top 2 choices:

1. Infliximab
   - Advantages: Proven efficacy in treating moderate to severe UC and can also be effective in treating pyoderma gangrenosum.
   - Disadvantages: Administered intravenously which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Adalimumab
   - Advantages: Can be used in the treatment of moderate to severe UC and may also be effective for pyoderma gangrenosum. Administered subcutaneously, which some patients may find more convenient.

part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14
The symptoms associated with IBD can be waxing and
waning, but the underlying systemic inﬂammation can lead

Complications
associated
with

inﬂammation in CD include strictures, obstructions, ﬁstulas,

include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and
colorectal cancer.2,4,17 Other complications include anemia,
nutritional deﬁciencies, loss of bone density, and progres-
sive loss of quality of life. In children, persistent inﬂamma-

associated
with

permanent loss of height.18 Similar to other chronic dis-
eases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the concept of cumula-
tive damage is now acknowledged in IBD and can be
measured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.19
Limited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,
Symptoms, and Complications
The concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and
symptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a
population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-
mation may precede formal diagnosis.22 The STRIDE

Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.

We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.

Officer Mora was 27 years old.

Officer Rivera was 22.

Based on the information provided, the patient has not previously been treated with Infliximab, Anti-TNF agents, or Vedolizumab. We also don't know if the patient is pregnant or has pouchitis.

Considering these factors, two potential choices of biological drugs could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

Vedolizumab specifically targets the gut and may have fewer systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. However, it is administered intravenously which may be inconvenient for some patients.

Ustekinumab targets interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 and may be a good choice for patients who have not responded to or cannot use Anti-TNF agents. It is also beneficial for patients with certain extraintestinal manifestations. However, it requires initial intravenous administration followed by subcutaneous injections, which may be a disadvantage for some patients.

Here are the top 2 choices:

1.

""disadvantages"": ""Administered intravenously which may be inconvenient, may not be as effective in patients with previous Anti-TNF agent failure""

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small

Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's age and disease severity. The patient is 55 years old and has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. This indicates that he may need a more aggressive treatment approach.

Second, the patient has extensive disease, which means that a large part of his colon is affected. This can make the disease more difficult to manage and may increase the risk of complications.

Third, the patient has a history of colonic polyps with high-grade dysplasia found 2 years ago. This is a precancerous condition and increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Therefore, any treatment chosen should not only manage the symptoms of ulcerative colitis but also reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.

Given these considerations, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be:

1. Infliximab: This is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It can reduce inflammation and help achieve remission.

Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. It can also promote mucosal healing, which may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.

Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It can also cause side effects such as increased risk of infections and allergic reactions.

2. Vedolizumab: This is a newer biological therapy that targets alpha4-beta7 integrin and is specifically designed to reduce inflammation in the gut.

Advantages: Vedolizumab is also effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. It is gut-specific, which may result in fewer systemic side effects compared to other biological therapies.

Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is also administered intravenously. Some patients may not respond to vedolizumab, and it may take longer to see an effect compared to other treatments.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

Limited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,
Symptoms, and Complications
The concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and
symptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a
population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-
mation may precede formal diagnosis.22 The STRIDE

ease) recommendations, updated recently, are meant to

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

text: associated with improved long-term outcomes.33 Data on
the impact of early therapy in UC are more limited, but, as
UC is also a progressive disease with risk of colorectal
cancer, surgery, and loss of colonic function, it is reasonable
to treat early to mitigate these risks.
How to Diagnose Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease
Early
IBD is heterogenous with wide variation in presentation.
Disease activity at presentation can range from mild to severe
and, as discussed, symptoms may be mild to none. These can
make the IBD diagnosis challenging, especially at a primary
care level. Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index
consisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage
and identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely
manner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct
to symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool
marker of inﬂammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC � 40 mg/
g carried a �1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the
diagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation
study, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index �8 and/
or FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from
4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to
100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of
clinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional
imaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.
We refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the
American College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn’s and
Colitis
Organization,
and
British
Society
of
Gastro-
enterology.37–40
Risk Stratiﬁcation and Prognostication
at Diagnosis
Appropriately
risk-stratifying
prognosis
in
patients
recently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection
of the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-
gies. CD and UC phenotype and disease activity at initial
presentation can vary widely from limited and mild to
extensive and complicated. Certain baseline clinical features
are associated with a more aggressive disease course with
higher risk of progression and complications. In higher-risk
patients, early control of inﬂammation with immune-
modifying therapies is critical. However, immunosuppres-
sive therapies are associated with safety concerns in the
short- and long-term, and entail signiﬁcant health care costs.
Therefore, a consideration of risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives
is key to develop an individualized therapeutic plan for the
informed patient.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-

First, we need to consider the patient's age and the severity of her condition. She is a young adult with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Second, we need to consider her preference for oral medication. This rules out treatments that are administered intravenously or subcutaneously.

From the reference text, we can see that upadacitinib and tofacitinib are oral medications that have shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Therefore, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be upadacitinib and tofacitinib.

Here are the pros and cons of these two choices:

Upadacitinib:
- Advantages: It has been ranked first in terms of clinical remission and clinical response in all patients, including those previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies and those naive to these drugs. It also ranked first for endoscopic improvement in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies and in patients who were anti-TNF-α naive.
- Disadvantages: There may be risks associated with its use, and it may not work in all patients.

Tofacitinib:
- Advantages: It has shown efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also an oral medication, which aligns with the patient's preference.
- Disadvantages: There may be risks associated with its use, and it may not work in all patients.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

for whole foods–based management of IBD, but future
studies will delineate this further.
Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107
Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after
weighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC
requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for
induction and maintenance of remission, with or without
IMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-
ciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes
compared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a
monotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential
for the colon to act as a “sink” for drugs, we advocate for
checking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing
and detecting immunogenicity early along with other
pharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no
clear beneﬁt of concomitant mesalamine with biologic
therapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to
biologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe
UC
where
TNFi,
cyclosporine,
or
subtotal
colectomy
followed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good
initial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe
UC is beyond the scope of this article.
Taking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into
Consideration
EIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30%–40% of
patients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs
before IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration
across specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-
gists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to
prompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to
allow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,
but also to allow for consideration of both in the selection of"

First, we need to consider the patient's age and disease severity. The patient is 41 years old and has moderate to severe distal ulcerative colitis.

Second, we need to consider the patient's extraintestinal manifestations. The patient has alopecia areata, which is an autoimmune condition that causes hair loss.

Given these factors, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be:

1. Ustekinumab: This drug is effective for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and could potentially help with the patient's alopecia areata as it is also used to treat psoriasis, another autoimmune skin disease.

Advantages: Ustekinumab has been shown to induce and maintain clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It may also help with the patient's alopecia areata.

Disadvantages: Potential side effects include respiratory infections, headache, and fatigue. It may also increase the risk of serious infections, cancer, and potentially serious heart conditions.

2. Adalimumab: This is another option for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Advantages: Adalimumab can reduce signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis and induce and maintain clinical remission.

Disadvantages: It can cause serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. It may also increase the risk of lymphoma and other cancers.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized and discussed thoroughly with the patient, considering the benefits and risks of each option.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: Positioning biologics in the treatment of IBD: A practical guide - Which mechanism of action for whom?

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis
Juan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet
Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Human: question
Let's think step by step.","Let's think step by step.

First, we need to consider the patient's age and disease severity. She is 38 years old and has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC).

Second, we need to consider her medical history. She had pulmonary tuberculosis which was treated 2 years ago. This is important because some biological drugs for UC, such as anti-TNF agents, can reactivate latent tuberculosis.

Given this information, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be:

1. Vedolizumab: This drug is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It does not carry a risk of reactivating tuberculosis.

2. Ustekinumab: This drug targets a different pathway (interleukin-12 and -23) and is not associated with a risk of reactivating tuberculosis.

Let's analyze the pros and cons of these two choices:

Vedolizumab:
- Advantages: It is gut-selective and has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe UC. It does not carry a risk of reactivating tuberculosis.
- Disadvantages: It may not work for all patients and it is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

Ustekinumab:
- Advantages: It targets a different pathway and can be effective in patients who have not responded to other treatments. It is not associated with a risk of reactivating tuberculosis.
- Disadvantages: It is a relatively new drug and long-term safety data is still being collected. It is also administered via injection, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

INTRODUCTION
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity,
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa,
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested.
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS

What is already known about this subject
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe.
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed
for this indication.
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety,
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these.

What are the new findings
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than
placebo.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for
patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis:
a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global
