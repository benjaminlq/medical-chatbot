However, treatment limitations for \nmoderately to severely active UC remain, including primary \nnonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and \nparenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, \nthere has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs \n(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-\nnogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the \nJanus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which \ntofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are \ncurrently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-\nverely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-\ntolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally \nadministered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their \nJAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and \nUPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 \nover JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-\nerentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-\ntional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs \nof JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-\ntively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), \nis also approved for use in UC.10\nWith this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid \ntoward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of \ndevelopment for moderately to severely active UC. Most \nrecently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and \npublished a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist \nnetwork meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely \nUC.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued."}, {"title": "First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis", "filename": "PIIS1542356520300446.pdf", "page": 5, "text": "41 years (interquartile range, 40\u201342 y), and 60%\n(interquartile range, 56%\u201363%) were men.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Infliximab:\n   - Pros: Infliximab is a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It can also be effective in treating extraintestinal manifestations like pyoderma gangrenosum.\n   - Cons: Infliximab may not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use. It is administered either intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.\n\n2. Adalimumab:\n   - Pros: Adalimumab is another TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor that can be used in the treatment of moderate to severe UC. It is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient than intravenous administration.\n   - Cons: Like Infliximab, Adalimumab may not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use. It may also be less effective than Infliximab in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic improvement.\n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential side effects of the drugs.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Ef\ufb01cacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and\nendoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We\nperformed a \ufb01xed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated\nodds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values.

The search for alternative agents for the \ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued."}, {"title": "First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis", "filename": "PIIS1542356520300446.pdf", "page": 5, "text": "41 years (interquartile range, 40\u201342 y), and 60%\n(interquartile range, 56%\u201363%) were men.
