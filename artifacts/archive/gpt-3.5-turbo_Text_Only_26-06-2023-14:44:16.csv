Question: question
Answer:
","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a newly diagnosed moderate UC patient with articular extraintestinal manifestations. As per the given context, the advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. Biologics targeting specific inflammatory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs (SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immunogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the Janus kinase (JAK) pathway, which is involved in the signaling of multiple cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. Based on the given context, the top two choices of biological drugs for the given patient profile are:

1. Tofacitinib: Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe UC. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. The advantages of Tofacitinib are that it is an oral medication, which is convenient for patients, and it has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. The disadvantages of Tofacitinib are that it can cause serious infections, malignancies, and thrombosis.

2. Vedolizumab: Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha4beta7 integrin, which is involved in the migration of lymphocytes to the gut. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. The advantages of Vedolizumab are that it is a targeted therapy that does not affect the entire immune system, and it has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. The disadvantages of Vedolizumab are that it can cause serious infections and infusion reactions.

Question: question
Answer:
","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a newly diagnosed 70-year-old female with severe UC. As per the given context, advanced therapies are rapidly evolving for moderately to severely active UC. However, there is no information provided on the patient's prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, extraintestinal manifestations, or pouchitis. The patient's age may be a factor in the choice of treatment, as younger age at diagnosis is linked to more frequent relapses, colectomy, and colorectal cancer.

Considering the patient's newly diagnosed severe UC, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.

Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist that blocks the migration of leukocytes into the gut. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. The advantages of Vedolizumab include its gut-selective mechanism of action, which reduces the risk of systemic immunosuppression and its efficacy in inducing and maintaining clinical remission. The disadvantages of Vedolizumab include the need for intravenous administration and the potential for infusion reactions.

Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the p40 subunit shared by interleukin-12 and interleukin-23. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. The advantages of Ustekinumab include its efficacy in inducing and maintaining clinical remission and its subcutaneous administration. The disadvantages of Ustekinumab include the potential for immunogenicity and the need for subcutaneous administration.

It is important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's medical history, disease severity, and response to previous treatments. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with a gastroenterologist to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for the patient.",,,,,,,"title:

Question: question
Answer:
","Based on the given context, the patient is a prior responder to Infliximab but is currently experiencing worsening colitis on endoscopy despite compliance. Therefore, the patient falls under the ""Prior response to Infliximab"" criteria.

Top 2 choices of biological drugs for this patient profile are:
1. Adalimumab
2. Golimumab

Advantages of Adalimumab:
- Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC patients who have failed Infliximab therapy.
- It is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for patients who prefer self-administration.
- Adalimumab has a lower risk of infusion reactions compared to Infliximab.

Disadvantages of Adalimumab:
- Adalimumab may increase the risk of infections, including serious infections such as tuberculosis and sepsis.
- It may also increase the risk of malignancies, particularly lymphoma and skin cancers.
- Adalimumab may cause injection site reactions, such as pain, swelling, and redness.

Advantages of Golimumab:
- Golimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC patients who have failed Infliximab therapy.
- It is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for patients who prefer self-administration.
- Golimumab has a lower risk of infusion reactions compared to Infliximab.

We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative

Question: question
Answer:
","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a newly diagnosed moderate UC patient with psoriasis. Psoriasis is an extraintestinal manifestation of IBD and may require systemic medication for rapid management. Anti-TNF therapy such as infliximab or adalimumab have good efficacy in several case reports and small case series for treating psoriasis in IBD patients. Ustekinumab and vedolizumab may also be effective in treating IBD-related psoriasis.

Top 2 choices of biological drugs for this patient profile are:
1. Ustekinumab - This drug has shown efficacy in treating psoriasis in IBD patients and may also be effective in treating UC. It targets the IL-12/23 pathway and has a favorable safety profile. However, it may increase the risk of infections and malignancies.
2. Adalimumab - This drug has good efficacy in treating psoriasis in IBD patients and has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe UC. It has a favorable safety profile but may increase the risk of infections and malignancies.

Advantages of Ustekinumab:
- Effective in treating psoriasis in IBD patients
- Targets the IL-12/23 pathway
- Favorable safety profile

Disadvantages of Ustekinumab:
- May increase the risk of infections and malignancies

Advantages of Adalimumab:
- Good efficacy in treating psoriasis in IBD patients
- Approved for the treatment of moderate to severe UC
- Favorable safety profile

The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-

Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and

Answer:
","Based on the given patient profile, the patient is a prior failure to Vedolizumab. Therefore, the top 2 choices of biological drugs for this patient would be Tofacitinib and Ustekinumab.

Tofacitinib has been shown to be superior to placebo for induction of clinical remission in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonist with or without Vedolizumab. Its advantages include oral administration and rapid onset of action. However, it has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, malignancies, and cardiovascular events.

Ustekinumab has also been shown to be superior to placebo for induction of clinical remission in patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonist with or without Vedolizumab. Its advantages include a different mechanism of action compared to TNF antagonists and Vedolizumab, and a favorable safety profile. However, it requires intravenous administration and its long-term safety is still being evaluated.",,,,,,,"title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global

Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were
included. Phase 2 RCTs were excluded because of their small sample sizes and inclusion of doses not further explored
in phase 3 RCTs. Summary data from intention-to-treat analyses were extracted from included reports by JSL and PAO.
The primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission. A network meta-analysis was done under the frequentist","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

lcerative colitis affects 1 in 200 to 1 in 400 people
in Western nations, and its global incidence and
prevalence is increasing.1 Although the majority of
patients have a mild–moderate course, approximately
10% to 15% of patients experience a severe disease
course with signiﬁcant morbidity, with frequent ﬂares
and
hospitalizations

immunosuppressive
therapies and corticosteroids, and impose a signiﬁcant
