Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Ustekinumab. 

1. Infliximab: 
- Advantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in treating both UC and rheumatological manifestations, which is beneficial for this patient who has articular extraintestinal manifestations. It has been supported by multiple trials in both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established efficacies in most rheumatological indications.
- Disadvantages: Infliximab is administered intravenously, which may not be convenient for all patients. It can also cause side effects such as infections, allergic reactions, and liver damage.

2. Ustekinumab: 
- Advantages: Ustekinumab is another option for patients with substantial comorbidities or contraindications to TNF antagonists. It is also administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for some patients.
- Disadvantages: Ustekinumab has limited efficacy in treating extraintestinal manifestations, which may not be ideal for this patient. It can also cause side effects such as infections, allergic reactions, and liver damage.

Extraintestinal manifestations occur in half of IBD patients and
represent an important cause of morbidity and disability (Vavricka et al.,
2011; Juillerat et al., 2020). Among EIMs, articular manifestations affect
30% of patients. They include non-inﬂammatory joint pain as well as
inﬂammatory joint manifestations including axial arthritis considered as
spondyloarthropathies. Since their approval in IBD, inﬂiximab and later
the other anti-TNF agents represent the best treatment choice in IBD
patient with rheumatological manifestations, supported by multiple trials
in both CD and UC, in addition to their well-established efﬁcacies in most
rheumatological indications (Herfarth et al., 2002; Generini et al., 2004;
Lofberg et al., 2012; Louis et al., 2018).

Vedolizumab may not represent the most appropriate biologic in
presence of articular manifestations of IBD. Indeed, by virtue of its
binding to α4β7 integrin, this antibody may not impede the entry of
proinﬂammatory cells in joints. In fact, it may even contribute to higher
inﬂux of these cells to distant sites, as suggested by Diaz et al., who
observed de novo extraintestinal manifestations in vedolizumab-treated
IBD patients (Diaz et al., 2020). An increased incidence of extra-
intestinal manifestation in vedolizumab treated IBD patients have also
been observed, compared to anti-TNF agents in a large American claims
database (Dubinsky et al., 2018). However, by improving disease activity
these drugs could still have an indirect impact on associated EIM, mostly
peripheral arthritis, as suggested by the recent EMOTIVE retrospective
analysis (Kopylov et al., 2021). Ustekinumab, however, has also limited","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with 
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults 
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. 
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those 
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], 
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by 
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] 
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for 
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary 
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and 
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, 
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs 
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

In the last 10 years small molecules, which can be administered orally and on a daily 
basis, have also been evaluated in moderate to severe UC. These include janus kinase 
inhibitors, such as tofacitinib,[20] and the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, 
ozanimod.[21] The comparative efficacy and safety of all these drugs has been assessed in 
prior network meta-analyses.[22, 23] These demonstrated that infliximab was ranked highest 
overall for efficacy, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked highest in patients with 
previous anti-TNF-α exposure. However, this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already 
several newer drugs that have shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not 
considered in these network meta-analyses.[24-26] We have therefore performed an updated 
network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of all biological therapies and small molecules","title:

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Ustekinumab. 

Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe UC. It is also beneficial for patients with extraintestinal manifestations like psoriasis. However, some patients may develop resistance to Infliximab over time, and it may also increase the risk of infections.

Ustekinumab is an interleukin inhibitor that is effective in treating moderate to severe UC and is also approved for the treatment of psoriasis. It has a good safety profile and is generally well tolerated. However, it may not be as effective as Infliximab in inducing remission in UC.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with 
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults 
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. 
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those 
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], 
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by 
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] 
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for 
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary 
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and 
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, 
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs 
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized 
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs 
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

(RCTs). Both studies also assessed all outcomes in overall 
populations, as well as induction efficacy outcomes by prior 
biologic exposure, though UPA was excluded from subgroup

Despite these recent publications, there remain key gaps 
in our understanding of the comparative efficacy and safety 
of advanced therapies for moderately to severely active UC. 
First, an indirect comparison of maintenance treatment 
safety remains unpublished. Second, so far only separate 
NMAs have been conducted for induction and maintenance 
treatments, when in practice clinicians would consider the 
overall comparative efficacy of treatments across induction 
and maintenance in their decision-making. Finally, Lasa et","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title:

DISCUSSION 
We conducted a contemporaneous systematic review and network meta-analysis of 
biological therapies and small molecules for moderate to severely active UC. This has 
incorporated data from 28 RCTs and over 12,500 patients. Overall, in terms of clinical 
remission and clinical response at 6 to 14 weeks, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in all 
patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these 
drugs. In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg. However, again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. 
ranked first in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were 
anti-TNF-α naïve. In terms of safety, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked last for total number of 
adverse events, and ustekinumab 130mg first. However, none of the drugs studied were more","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Discussion 
We reviewed available efficacy and safety data from RCTs 
of biologics and small molecule drugs (approved or in a 
late stage of development) for induction and maintenance 
treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative 
colitis. All small molecule drugs and approved biologics, 
except filgotinib 100 mg, were significantly better than 
placebo in terms of inducing clinical remission and 
endoscopic improvement. A novel finding of this study 
was that upadacitinib ranked highest for the induction of 
clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, and 
was notably superior for these outcomes to all other 
interventions in our network meta-analysis. Infliximab 
ranked second for both outcomes. Regarding safety, 
vedolizumab was still ranked as the safest drug in 
terms of adverse events and serious adverse events, as

ABSTRACT 
Objective: Biological therapies and small molecules continue to be evaluated in moderate to 
severely active ulcerative colitis, but are often studied in placebo-controlled trials, meaning 
their relative efficacy and safety is unknown. We examined this in a network meta-analysis.  
Design: We searched the literature to October 2021 to identify eligible trials. We judged 
efficacy using clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, or clinical response, and 
according to previous exposure or non-exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
therapy. We also assessed safety. We used a random effects model and reported data as 
pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interventions were ranked 
according to their P-score. 
Results: We identified 28 trials (12,504 patients). Based on failure to achieve clinical 
remission, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first versus placebo (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.80,"

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Ustekinumab (UST) and Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitors (TNFi).

1. Ustekinumab (UST)
- Advantages: UST is recommended for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, which the patient has. Therefore, it could potentially treat both conditions.
- Disadvantages: The effectiveness of UST in treating ulcerative colitis is limited. It may not be as effective as other treatments for some patients.

2. Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitors (TNFi)
- Advantages: TNFi is also recommended for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It has been shown to be effective in treating both ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
- Disadvantages: Some patients may develop resistance to TNFi over time. Additionally, TNFi can have side effects including increased risk of infection.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's overall health, other medications, and personal preferences. The patient should have a detailed discussion with their healthcare provider to decide the best treatment option.

text: peripheral arthritis, as suggested by the recent EMOTIVE retrospective
analysis (Kopylov et al., 2021). Ustekinumab, however, has also limited
role in this indication, as this drug is also indicated in rheumatoid
arthritis (Kerschbaumer et al., 2020). Dermatological extraintestinal
manifestations occur in up to 15% of IBD patients (Vavricka et al., 2011).
The most common, erythema nodosum, depends on the underlying dis-
ease activity, whereas pyoderma gangrenosum may be associated with
active or inactive intestinal disease and requires rapid management, most
commonly with systemic medication. Treatment includes oral cortico-
steroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and anti-TNF therapy (inﬂiximab or

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Infliximab and Upadacitinib. 

1. Infliximab: 
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF antagonist and has been shown to be the most efficient agent among anti-TNF agents. It can be used in patients with prior exposure to vedolizumab and ustekinumab. 
   - Disadvantages: The patient has already shown a loss of response to anti-TNF agents, which may limit the effectiveness of Infliximab. Additionally, there may be risks of serious infections and malignancy, especially in older patients with multiple comorbidities.

2. Upadacitinib: 
   - Advantages: Upadacitinib has been suggested to be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients. It may be a good option for patients with prior failure of infliximab.
   - Disadvantages: The safety profile of Upadacitinib is similar to other advanced therapies, which means it may also carry risks of serious infections and malignancy. The patient's older age and potential comorbidities may increase these risks.

Please note that the final decision should be made in consultation with the patient's healthcare provider, taking into account the patient's overall health status, comorbidities, and preferences.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety 
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary 
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across 
advanced therapies.

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety 
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary 
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across 
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized 
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

comparing the efﬁcacy between all available biologics is addressed
(Singh et al., 2021). The conclusion was that in biologic-naïve patients
with moderate to severely active CD, inﬂiximab, adalimumab, and
ustekinumab are the most effective compared to vedolizumab and cer-
tolizumab pegol. Inﬂiximab was considered the strongest for induction.
However, in patients exposed to anti-TNF agents (mostly to inﬂiximab),
the beneﬁt of one biological agent over the other remains uncertain. A
summary of the efﬁcacies of the various biological agents, according to
the line of treatment and previous treatment failures and patients'
phenotype, is provided in Table 2. The ﬁnal word about the efﬁcacy of

Data from the literature on strategies to position biological therapy is
scarce. Guidance and consensus statements exist to help aid the decision
making process. However there is a tendency to position all biologics on
the same level and to consider them as interchangeable in the ECCO
Guidelines (Torres et al., 2020; Raine et al., 2021). These guidelines, used

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%

Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety 
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary 
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across 
advanced therapies.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Human: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab (VDZ) and Ustekinumab (UST). 

1. Vedolizumab (VDZ)
   - Advantages: VDZ is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, which means it specifically targets the gut and spares the rest of the body from potential side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
   - Disadvantages: It may take several weeks to months for patients to see an improvement in their symptoms. Some patients may experience side effects such as headache, joint pain, nausea, or fever. There is also a risk of serious infections.

2. Ustekinumab (UST)
   - Advantages: UST has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It works by blocking a specific protein that causes inflammation in the body. It can be administered at home as a subcutaneous injection.
   - Disadvantages: Some patients may experience side effects such as upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and fatigue. There is also a risk of serious infections and it may take several weeks to see an improvement in symptoms.

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential risks and benefits. It's important to have a detailed discussion with the patient about these options.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized 
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs 
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global","title:

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with 
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults 
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. 
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those 
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], 
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by 
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] 
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for 
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary 
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and 
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, 
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs 
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

analysis (Kopylov et al., 2021). Ustekinumab, however, has also limited
role in this indication, as this drug is also indicated in rheumatoid
arthritis (Kerschbaumer et al., 2020). Dermatological extraintestinal
manifestations occur in up to 15% of IBD patients (Vavricka et al., 2011).
The most common, erythema nodosum, depends on the underlying dis-
ease activity, whereas pyoderma gangrenosum may be associated with
active or inactive intestinal disease and requires rapid management, most
commonly with systemic medication. Treatment includes oral cortico-
steroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and anti-TNF therapy (inﬂiximab or
adalimumab), drugs that have good efﬁcacy in several cases reports and
small case series (Juillerat et al., 2007). Cases reports and a recent
semi-systematic review suggest that IBD cutaneous lesions may respond
to the newer IBD drugs. This is the case for ustekinumab and less","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel"

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

Introduction 
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, potentially 
disabling condition that is clinically characterised 
by bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and tenesmus.1 
Ulcerative colitis most commonly presents during the 
third and fifth decades of life, and is associated with an 
impaired health-related quality of life and considerable 
economic burden.2,3
Nearly 20 years ago, the advent of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor biologics (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and 
golimumab) revolutionised therapeutics for ulcerative 
colitis, enabling better disease control in terms of 
increasing the rates of mucosal healing, deep remission, 
and corticosteroid-free remission, and improving quality 
of life. Biologics with other targets were later approved 
for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,","title:

METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with 
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults 
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. 
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those 
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], 
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by 
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] 
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for 
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary 
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and 
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations,
