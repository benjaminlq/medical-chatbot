This means he is a new patient, not under maintenance. There is no information about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, or prior failure to Vedolizumab. His age is 40, which is within the typical age range for UC onset. There is no information about pregnancy, which is not applicable as the patient is male. He has extraintestinal manifestations, specifically in the joints (articular). There is no information about pouchitis.\n\nGiven this profile, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab. \n\nVedolizumab is an effective option for moderate UC and has shown superiority over Adalimumab in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC. It targets \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, which is involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, thus it could be effective in treating UC. However, it may not be as effective in treating extraintestinal manifestations.\n\nUstekinumab, on the other hand, targets the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, which are involved in the pathogenesis of UC. It has shown efficacy in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC. It may also be effective in treating extraintestinal manifestations, including articular ones.\n\nHere are the pros and cons of these two drugs:\n\n1. Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Effective in treating moderate UC, superior to Adalimumab in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement.\n   - Disadvantages: May not be as effective in treating extraintestinal manifestations.\n\n2.

However, treatment limitations for \nmoderately to severely active UC remain, including primary \nnonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and \nparenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, \nthere has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs \n(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-\nnogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the \nJanus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which \ntofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are \ncurrently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-\nverely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-\ntolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally \nadministered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their \nJAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and \nUPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 \nover JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-\nerentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-\ntional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs \nof JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-\ntively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), \nis also approved for use in UC.10\nWith this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid \ntoward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of \ndevelopment for moderately to severely active UC. Most \nrecently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and \npublished a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist \nnetwork meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely \nUC.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to \nAEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during \nmaintenance.\nConclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety \nacross advanced therapies.\nLay Summary \nIndirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-\nsion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across \nadvanced therapies.\nKey Words: ulcerative colitis, clinical trials, advanced therapies, network meta-analysis\nIntroduction\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-\nease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized \nby bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-\nlaise, weight loss, and fever.

However, treatment limitations for \nmoderately to severely active UC remain, including primary \nnonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and \nparenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, \nthere has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs \n(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-\nnogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the \nJanus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which \ntofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are \ncurrently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-\nverely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-\ntolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi\u2019s.4\u20137 All orally \nadministered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their \nJAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and \nUPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 \nover JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-\nerentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-\ntional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs \nof JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-\ntively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), \nis also approved for use in UC.10\nWith this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid \ntoward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of \ndevelopment for moderately to severely active UC. Most \nrecently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and \npublished a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist \nnetwork meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of \nbiologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely \nUC.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

There is no information provided about the patient having Pouchitis.\n\nGiven the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs could be:\n\n1. Infliximab: This drug targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in moderate to severe UC. It also has shown efficacy in treating ankylosing spondylitis, which is an extraintestinal manifestation in this patient.\n\nAdvantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. It is also effective in treating ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nDisadvantages: Infliximab can have potential side effects including risk of infection, allergic reactions, and potential liver damage. It is also administered intravenously which may be inconvenient for some patients.\n\n2. Adalimumab: This is another drug that targets TNF-\u03b1 and has been tested for UC. It is also used to treat ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nAdvantages: Adalimumab can be used in patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate other forms of treatment. It is also effective in treating ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nDisadvantages: Adalimumab can have side effects including risk of infection, allergic reactions, and potential liver damage. It is administered through subcutaneous injection which some patients might find inconvenient.\n\nPlease note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential side effects of the drugs. The patient should have a detailed discussion with their healthcare provider to choose the most appropriate treatment.\n\n[{\"drug_name\": \"Infliximab\", \"advantages\": \"Effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC and treating ankylosing spondylitis\", \"disadvantages\": \"Potential side effects including risk of infection, allergic reactions, and potential liver damage.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

This indicates the need for potent treatment options.\n- The patient has a history of lymphoma. This is important because some treatments for ulcerative colitis can potentially increase the risk of certain types of cancer, including lymphoma.\n\nBased on these considerations, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab. \n\nVedolizumab specifically targets the gut and has been shown to be effective in treating ulcerative colitis. It is generally well-tolerated and has a lower risk of serious side effects compared to some other treatments. However, it may not work for everyone and it can take several weeks to start working.\n\nUstekinumab is another option that could be considered.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-\nciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes\ncompared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a\nmonotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential\nfor the colon to act as a \u201csink\u201d for drugs, we advocate for\nchecking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing\nand detecting immunogenicity early along with other\npharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no\nclear bene\ufb01t of concomitant mesalamine with biologic\ntherapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to\nbiologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe\nUC\nwhere\nTNFi,\ncyclosporine,\nor\nsubtotal\ncolectomy\nfollowed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good\ninitial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe\nUC is beyond the scope of this article.\nTaking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into\nConsideration\nEIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30%\u201340% of\npatients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs\nbefore IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration\nacross specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-\ngists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to\nprompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to\nallow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,\nbut also to allow for consideration of both in the selection of"}]}, {"question": "39 year-old male with moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis who had malignant melanoma which was treated 3 years ago\n", "answer": "Given the patient's history of malignant melanoma, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with certain biological drugs.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

This is a common practice in managing moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, where the same drug used for induction, if successful, is continued for maintenance. \n\nHowever, the choice of maintenance therapy can also depend on other factors such as the patient's overall health, presence of any other diseases, and her personal preferences. \n\nHere are the top 2 choices of biological drugs for this patient:\n\n1. Vedolizumab\nAdvantages: The patient has already shown a positive response to Vedolizumab during the induction phase, suggesting that she may continue to respond well during the maintenance phase. Vedolizumab is also generally well-tolerated with a good safety profile.\nDisadvantages: As with any medication, there is a risk of side effects, which in the case of Vedolizumab can include headache, joint pain, nausea, or fever. There is also a risk of infusion-related reactions.\n\n2. Infliximab\nAdvantages: Infliximab is another option for maintenance therapy in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in many patients.\nDisadvantages: Infliximab is administered via infusion, which may be less convenient for some patients. It also carries a risk of side effects, including increased risk of infection.\n\nPlease note that the final decision should be made in consultation with the patient's healthcare provider, taking into account the patient's overall health, lifestyle, and preferences.\n\nOutput:\n[\n  {\n    \"drug_name\": \"Vedolizumab\",\n    \"advantages\": \"The patient has already shown a positive response to Vedolizumab during the induction phase, suggesting that she may continue to respond well during the maintenance phase.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued."}, {"title": "First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis", "filename": "PIIS1542356520300446.pdf", "page": 5, "text": "41 years (interquartile range, 40\u201342 y), and 60%\n(interquartile range, 56%\u201363%) were men.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

He is relatively young and has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. This suggests that he may benefit from more aggressive treatment options.\n\nSecond, the patient has a co-existing condition, spondylarthristis, which is an extraintestinal manifestation of UC. This may influence the choice of treatment as some drugs may have beneficial effects on both conditions.\n\nGiven this information, the top two choices of biological drugs could be:\n\n1. Infliximab: This is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that has shown efficacy in treating moderate to severe UC. It also has the advantage of being beneficial for patients with spondylarthristis.\n\nAdvantages: Infliximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in UC. It can also manage extraintestinal manifestations such as spondylarthristis.\n\nDisadvantages: Infliximab can have potential side effects including risk of infections, allergic reactions, and potential for developing antibodies against the drug leading to loss of response.\n\n2. Ustekinumab: This is an interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 inhibitor. It has been shown to be effective in patients who have had prior exposure to anti-TNF agents.\n\nAdvantages: Ustekinumab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in UC.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to \nAEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during \nmaintenance.\nConclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety \nacross advanced therapies.\nLay Summary \nIndirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-\nsion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across \nadvanced therapies.\nKey Words: ulcerative colitis, clinical trials, advanced therapies, network meta-analysis\nIntroduction\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-\nease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized \nby bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-\nlaise, weight loss, and fever.

The patient is 53 years old and has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. This indicates that the patient may require a more aggressive treatment approach.\n\nSecond, the patient has low albumin levels. Albumin is a protein made by the liver that keeps fluid in the bloodstream so it doesn't leak into other tissues. Low albumin levels can be a sign of liver disease or inflammatory conditions like ulcerative colitis. It can also indicate malnutrition, which can affect the patient's ability to recover.\n\nGiven the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Infliximab and Adalimumab. \n\nInfliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that can reduce signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis and induce and maintain remission.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-\ncluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and \nupadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by \nadjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.\nResults:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were \nhighest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance \namong bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or \nserious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to \nAEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during \nmaintenance.\nConclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety \nacross advanced therapies.\nLay Summary \nIndirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-\nsion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across \nadvanced therapies.\nKey Words: ulcerative colitis, clinical trials, advanced therapies, network meta-analysis\nIntroduction\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-\nease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized \nby bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-\nlaise, weight loss, and fever.

However, the presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis with decompensated cirrhosis complicates the situation, as some treatments may not be suitable due to potential liver toxicity.\n\nConsidering the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab.\n\n1. Vedolizumab:\n   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.\n   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Vedolizumab is that it may not be as effective in patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy. Additionally, it is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.\n\n2. Ustekinumab:\n   - Advantages: Ustekinumab has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It targets a different pathway (interleukin-12 and -23) compared to anti-TNF and vedolizumab, so it may work for patients who have not responded to those treatments.\n   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab is administered via injection, which some patients may find inconvenient. It may also have potential side effects, including increased risk of infections.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential risk of side effects. The patient should also be closely monitored due to his liver condition. \n\nPlease note that this advice is based on the general knowledge about the treatments for ulcerative colitis and may not fully apply to this specific case. The treating physician should make the final decision based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient. \n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"drug_name\": \"Vedolizumab\",\n    \"advantages\": \"Gut-selective immunosuppressant, less systemic side effects, effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis\",\n    \"disadvantages\": \"May not be as effective in patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy, administered intravenously\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"drug_name\": \"Ustekinumab\",\n    \"advantages\": \"Effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, targets a different pathway compared to anti-TNF and vedolizumab\",\n    \"disadvantages\": \"Administered via injection, potential side effects including increased risk of infections\"\n  }\n]", "sources": [{"title": "Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis", "filename": "gutjnl-2021-326390R2 CLEAN.pdf", "page": 7, "text": "Burr et al. \n \n7 of 45 \nINTRODUCTION \n  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes \ncontinuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a \nvariable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the \ndisease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, \nsome of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the \ntreatment of UC has, therefore, continued."}, {"title": "Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2468125321003770-main.pdf", "page": 0, "text": "Articles\nwww.thelancet.com/gastrohep   Vol 7   February 2022 \n161\nLancet Gastroenterol Hepatol \n2022; 7: 161\u201370\nPublished Online \nNovember 29, 2021 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/ \nS2468-1253(21)00377-0\nSee Comment page 110\n*Contributed equally\nInflammatory Bowel Disease \nUnit, Gastroenterology \nSection, Department of \nInternal Medicine, Centro de \nEducaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica e \nInvestigaciones Cl\u00ednicas, \nBuenos Aires, Argentina \n(J S Lasa MD, P A Olivera MD); \nGastroenterology Department, \nHospital Brit\u00e1nico de Buenos \nAires, Buenos Aires, Argentina \n(J S Lasa); Zane Cohen Centre \nfor Digestive Diseases, \nLunenfeld-Tanenbaum \nResearch Institute, Sinai Health \nSystem, Toronto, ON, Canada \n(P A Olivera); Division of \nGastroenterology, Mount Sinai \nHospital, University of Toronto, \nToronto, ON, Canada \n(P A Olivera); Gastroenterology \nand Endoscopy, IRCCS Ospedale \nSan Raffaele and University \nVita-Salute San Raffaele, \nMilano, Italy \n(Prof S Danese MD); INSERM \nNGERE and Department of \nHepatogastroenterology, \nNancy University Hospital, \nLorraine University, \nVandoeuvre-l\u00e9s-Nancy, France \n(Prof L Peyrin-Biroulet MD) \nCorrespondence to: \nProf Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet, \nINSERM NGERE and Department \nof Hepatogastroenterology, \nNancy University Hospital, \nLorraine University, Vandoeuvre-\nl\u00e8s-Nancy F-54511, France \npeyrinbiroulet@gmail.com\nEfficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for \npatients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: \na systematic review and network meta-analysis \nJuan S Lasa*, Pablo A Olivera*, Silvio Danese, Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet\nSummary\nBackground There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.

IBD can cause signi\ufb01cant morbidity and lead\nto complications such as strictures, \ufb01stulas, infections, and\ncancer.\nIn\nchildren,\nIBD\ncan\nalso\nresult\nin\ngrowth\nimpairment and pubertal delays. IBD is highly heteroge-\nnous, with severity ranging from mild to severe and\nsymptoms ranging from mild to debilitating. Delay in IBD\ndiagnosis, especially in Crohn\u2019s disease, is common and\nassociated with adverse outcomes. Early diagnosis and\nprompt institution of treatment are the cornerstones for\nimproving outcomes and maximizing health. Early diag-\nnosis requires a low threshold of suspicion and red \ufb02ags to\nguide early specialist referral at the primary provider\nlevel. Although the armamentarium of IBD medications is\ngrowing, many patients will not respond to treatment, and\nthe selection of \ufb01rst-line therapy is critical. Risk strati\ufb01-\ncation of disease severity, based on clinical, demographic,\nand serologic markers, can help guide selection of \ufb01rst-line\ntherapy. Clinical decision support tools, genomics, and\nother biomarkers of response to therapy and risk of\nadverse events are the future of personalized medicine.\nAfter starting appropriate therapy, it is important to\ncon\ufb01rm remission using objective end points (treat to\ntarget) with continued control of in\ufb02ammation with\nadjustment of therapy using surrogate biomarkers (tight\ncontrol).

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Infliximab:\n- Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in moderate to severe UC. It can be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in UC patients. It may also be beneficial for the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum, an extraintestinal manifestation of UC.\n- Disadvantages: Infliximab can have potentially serious side effects, including increased risk of infections. It may also lead to the development of antibodies against the drug, reducing its effectiveness over time. It is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.\n\n2. Vedolizumab:\n- Advantages: Vedolizumab is a newer biological therapy that targets \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe UC. It may be a good option for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors.\n- Disadvantages: Vedolizumab may not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Danese et al34 have proposed a Red Flags Index\nconsisting of a 21-item questionnaire to help providers triage\nand identify patients with concerning symptoms in a timely\nmanner and refer to specialists appropriately. A useful adjunct\nto symptom-based criteria is fecal calprotectin (FC), a stool\nmarker of in\ufb02ammation; in a large meta-analysis, FC \ufffd 40 mg/\ng carried a \ufffd1% probability of IBD, effectively excluding the\ndiagnosis of IBD.35 Similarly, in the Red Flags Index validation\nstudy, combining the index with FC (Red Flags Index \ufffd8 and/\nor FC >250 mg/g) increased the positive predictive value from\n4% to 21% and negative predictive value from 97% to\n100%.36 Diagnostic criteria for IBD involve a composite of\nclinical symptoms, endoscopic, biomarker, and cross-sectional\nimaging features, which are beyond the scope of this review.\nWe refer readers to the excellent guidelines laid out by the\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, European Crohn\u2019s and\nColitis\nOrganization,\nand\nBritish\nSociety\nof\nGastro-\nenterology.37\u201340\nRisk Strati\ufb01cation and Prognostication\nat Diagnosis\nAppropriately\nrisk-stratifying\nprognosis\nin\npatients\nrecently diagnosed with IBD is essential to inform selection\nof the most appropriate treatment and monitoring strate-\ngies.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by \nadjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.\nResults:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were \nhighest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance \namong bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or \nserious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to \nAEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during \nmaintenance.\nConclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety \nacross advanced therapies.\nLay Summary \nIndirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-\nsion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across \nadvanced therapies.\nKey Words: ulcerative colitis, clinical trials, advanced therapies, network meta-analysis\nIntroduction\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-\nease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized \nby bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-\nlaise, weight loss, and fever.

In the VARSITY trial, the only\nhead-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n \u00bc 769), VDZ was supe-\nrior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;\nP \u00bc .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P\n< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST\nmay not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-\nularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety pro\ufb01le.107\nThiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after\nweighing risks against bene\ufb01ts.64 In patients with severe UC\nrequiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for\ninduction and maintenance of remission, with or without\nIMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-\nciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes\ncompared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a\nmonotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential\nfor the colon to act as a \u201csink\u201d for drugs, we advocate for\nchecking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing\nand detecting immunogenicity early along with other\npharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no\nclear bene\ufb01t of concomitant mesalamine with biologic\ntherapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to\nbiologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe\nUC\nwhere\nTNFi,\ncyclosporine,\nor\nsubtotal\ncolectomy\nfollowed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good\ninitial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe\nUC is beyond the scope of this article.\nTaking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into\nConsideration\nEIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30%\u201340% of\npatients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs\nbefore IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration\nacross specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-\ngists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to\nprompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to\nallow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,\nbut also to allow for consideration of both in the selection of"}]}, {"question": "41 year-old man with moderate to severe distal ulcerative colitis and alocpecia areata.\n", "answer": "1.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or \nserious infections across therapies.

She has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis, which was treated two years ago. \n\nGiven her history of tuberculosis, it's important to consider the risk of reactivation when choosing a biological drug. Some biological drugs, such as TNF-alpha inhibitors like Infliximab and Adalimumab, have been associated with an increased risk of reactivating latent tuberculosis. \n\nBased on the reference text, two potential choices could be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab. \n\nVedolizumab specifically targets the gut and has less systemic immunosuppressive effects, which could be beneficial for a patient with a history of tuberculosis. \n\nUstekinumab, on the other hand, targets interleukin-12 and -23 and has been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. \n\nHowever, the final decision should be made after a thorough discussion with the patient about the potential benefits and risks of each treatment option, and after considering other factors such as the patient's preferences, lifestyle, and overall health status.\n\nHere are the top 2 choices:\n\n1. Vedolizumab\nAdvantages: It is gut-specific, so it may have fewer systemic side effects.

Management of these is medical, for the most \npart, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates \n(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are \nusually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse \neffects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to \nmaintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel \ndrugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in \ngenome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  \nThe first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory \ncytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in \nmoderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-\u03b1 have been tested, such as \nadalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting \u03b1 or \u03b2 \nintegrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, \nsuch as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory \ncytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. \nHowever, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks \nassociated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously \nor subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients.

Ef\ufb01cacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and\nendoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We\nperformed a \ufb01xed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated\nodds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative\nranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of\nRecommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).\nRESULTS:\nIn biologic-na\u00efve patients, in\ufb02iximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR\nvs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67\u20136.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)\n(moderate con\ufb01dence in estimates [CE]).

We aimed \nto compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with \nmoderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.\nMethods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane \nCentral Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and \nJuly 1, 2021. Major congresses\u2019 databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually.

Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-\ncluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and \nupadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by \nadjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.\nResults:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were \nhighest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance \namong bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or \nserious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to \nAEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during \nmaintenance.\nConclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety \nacross advanced therapies.\nLay Summary \nIndirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-\nsion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across \nadvanced therapies.\nKey Words: ulcerative colitis, clinical trials, advanced therapies, network meta-analysis\nIntroduction\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-\nease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized \nby bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-\nlaise, weight loss, and fever.
