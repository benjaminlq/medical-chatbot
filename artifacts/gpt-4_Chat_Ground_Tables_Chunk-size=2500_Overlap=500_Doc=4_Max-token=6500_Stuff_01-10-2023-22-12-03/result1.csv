Human: PATIENT PROFILE: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Infliximab.

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is an effective option for moderate UC and may be a better first-choice option than TNFi due to its safety profile. It has been shown to be superior to Adalimumab in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in moderate to severe UC.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Vedolizumab is that it may not be feasible due to payer preference. Also, it may not be as effective as Infliximab in patients with severe UC requiring hospitalization.

2. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is an effective option with a good safety profile. It is the preferred biologic for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with severe UC requiring hospitalization. It has also been shown to be effective in patients with extraintestinal manifestations.
   - Disadvantages: The main disadvantage of Infliximab is that it may require checking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing and detecting immunogenicity early along with other pharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A User's Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

for whole foods–based management of IBD, but future
studies will delineate this further.
Early Therapy of Ulcerative Colitis
In UC, mild disease can be managed with oral and/or
topical mesalamine therapy, generally with adequate con-
trol of disease.38 For moderate UC, VDZ and UST are effec-
tive options,105,106 and may be better ﬁrst-choice options
than TNFi, given safety proﬁle. In the VARSITY trial, the only
head-to-head trial of 2 biologics (n ¼ 769), VDZ was supe-
rior to ADA in achieving clinical remission (31.3% vs 22.5%;
P ¼ .006) and endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs 27.7%; P
< .001) in moderate to severe UC.105 In case VDZ or UST
may not be feasible due to payer preference, TNFi, partic-
ularly IFX, is an effective option with good safety proﬁle.107
Thiopurines may be considered in moderate UC after
weighing risks against beneﬁts.64 In patients with severe UC
requiring hospitalization, IFX is the preferred biologic for
induction and maintenance of remission, with or without
IMM. Combination therapy in the SUCCESS trial was asso-
ciated with improved clinical, but not endoscopic, outcomes
compared to IFX monotherapy.108 When using IFX as a
monotherapy in moderate to severe UC, given the potential
for the colon to act as a “sink” for drugs, we advocate for
checking early drug concentrations to ensure proper dosing
and detecting immunogenicity early along with other
pharmacokinetic and safety-related variables.109 There is no
clear beneﬁt of concomitant mesalamine with biologic
therapy in UC and it can be stopped in patients escalating to
biologics.110 Some patients may present with acute severe
UC
where
TNFi,
cyclosporine,
or
subtotal
colectomy
followed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis can be a good
initial strategy; discussion of management of acute severe
UC is beyond the scope of this article.
Taking Extraintestinal Manifestation Into
Consideration
EIMs are common in IBD, estimated to affect 30%–40% of
patients.111,112 In a Swiss cohort study, symptoms of EIMs
before IBD in one-quarter of the patients113; collaboration
across specialties, including but not limited to rheumatolo-
gists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, is vital not only to
prompt referral of patients with EIM suspicious for IBD to
allow for expedient initiation of therapy for both conditions,
but also to allow for consideration of both in the selection of"

nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared

like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and 
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by 
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were 
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance 
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or 
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to 
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during 
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety 
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary 
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across 
advanced therapies.

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and 
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by 
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were 
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance 
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or 
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to 
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during 
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety 
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary 
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across 
advanced therapies.

Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel dis-
ease that affects the colorectum and is clinically characterized 
by bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, ma-
laise, weight loss, and fever. Disease onset commonly occurs 
between the ages of 15 and 30 years and the annual global

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

higher vulnerability to adverse IBD-related outcomes in
these vulnerable groups should prompt careful moni-
toring to limit adverse outcomes.
There are increasing data on sex-based differences in
IBD phenotype and outcomes, which may signal differences
in pathogenic pathways and progression. Of note, extra-
intestinal manifestations (EIMs) consistently tend to be
more common in female patients (CD: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9–
2.8 and UC: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3, in a large Dutch Bio-
Bank).56 Similarly, in a retrospective pediatric study of
nearly 1000 patients with CD, girls were more likely to have
EIMs and less likely to have growth impairment compared
with boys,57 the latter is possibly related to lower insulin-
like growth factor-1 level in boys.58

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Efficacy and Safety of Advanced Therapies
incidence ranges from 9 to 20 cases per 100 000 per year with 
higher incidence in North America and Northern Europe.1
The advanced therapeutic armamentarium for adults 
with moderately to severely active UC is rapidly evolving. 
For over 20 years, biologics targeting specific inflamma-
tory pathways have been the mainstay, beginning with those 
targeting tumor necrosis alpha (TNFi; eg, infliximab [INF], 
adalimumab [ADA], and golimumab [GOL]) followed by 
biologics with other modes of action (eg, vedolizumab [VED] 
and ustekinumab [UST]). However, treatment limitations for 
moderately to severely active UC remain, including primary 
nonresponse, secondary loss of response, immunogenicity, and 
parenteral administration.2 To overcome these limitations, 
there has been increasing interest in small molecule drugs 
(SMDs), which can be orally administered and lack immu-
nogenicity.3 Of particular interest are SMDs that inhibit the 
Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated inflammatory pathway, of which 
tofacitinib (TOF), filgotinib (FIL), and upadacitinib (UPA) are 
currently approved for use in adults with moderately to se-
verely active UC who have had an inadequate response or in-
tolerance to conventional therapy and/or TNFi’s.4–7 All orally 
administered, TOF, FIL, and UPA are distinguished by their 
JAK selectivity: TOF is a pan-JAK inhibitor while FIL and 
UPA are approximately 30- and 60-fold selective for JAK1 
over JAK2, respectively.8,9 In human cellular assays, UPA pref-
erentially inhibits signaling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with func-
tional selectivity over cytokine receptors that signal via pairs 
of JAK2.5 In addition, ozanimod (OZA), a SMD that selec-
tively modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor (S1P), 
is also approved for use in UC.10
With this rapid innovation, much attention has been paid 
toward establishing the comparative efficacy and safety of 
biologics and SMDs that are approved or in late stages of 
development for moderately to severely active UC. Most 
recently, Lasa et al11 and Burr et al12 each conducted and 
published a systematic literature review (SLR) and frequentist 
network meta-analysis (NMA) on the efficacy and safety of 
biologics and SMDs for patients with moderately to severely 
UC. Both studies assessed all outcomes after induction (6–14 
weeks); Lasa et al11 additionally assessed efficacy after main-
tenance (26–66 weeks) separately for treat-through (TT) and"

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and 
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by 
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were 
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance 
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or 
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to 
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during 
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety 
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary 
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across 
advanced therapies.

integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed 
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with 
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and 
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo."

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and 
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by 
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were 
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance 
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or 
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to 
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during 
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety 
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary 
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across 
advanced therapies.

Background:  Given rapid innovation in advanced therapies for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), we investigated their com-
parative efficacy and safety during induction and maintenance through network meta-analysis.
Methods:  Using Bayesian methods, endpoints of clinical remission and clinical response per Full Mayo score, and endoscopic improvement 
were assessed in bio-naive and -exposed populations. Safety was assessed in overall populations by all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, 
discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and 
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title:

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo."

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

text: What You Need to Know
Background
A systematic review and network meta-analysis is
needed to compare efﬁcacy and safety of ﬁrst-line
(biologic-naïve) and second-line (prior exposure to
tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for
treatment of moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis.
Findings
Inﬂiximab was ranked highest in biologic-naïve pa-
tients, and ustekinumab and tofacitinib were ranked
highest in patients with prior exposure to TNF an-
tagonists, for induction of remission and endoscopic
improvement. More trials of direct comparisons are
needed to inform clinical decision-making with
greater conﬁdence.
Implications for patient care
Patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative
colitis should receive inﬂiximab or vedolizumab as
ﬁrst-line therapy, or ustekinumab or tofacitinib if
they have prior exposure to TNF antagonists.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo.","title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the

• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo."

Human: PATIENT PROFILE: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab. 

1. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also less likely to cause liver toxicity, which is important in this patient with decompensated cirrhosis.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may also take several weeks to months to see the full effect of the drug. 

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is effective in treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is administered subcutaneously, which may be more convenient for some patients. It also has a good safety profile and is less likely to cause liver toxicity.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may take several weeks to months to see the full effect of the drug. It is also more expensive than other treatments.

It's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential for side effects. The patient should also be closely monitored for any signs of liver toxicity given his decompensated cirrhosis.",,,,,,,"title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

Summary
Background There is a growing armamentarium for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. We aimed 
to compare the relative efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of patients with 
moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and 
July 1, 2021. Major congresses’ databases from Jan 1, 2018, to July 3, 2021, were reviewed manually. Phase 3, placebo-
controlled or head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of biologics or small 
molecule drugs as induction or maintenance therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Approach to the Management of Recently Diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Users Guide for Adult and Pediatric Gastroenterologists

Human: PATIENT PROFILE: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient has moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and has lost response to tofacitinib. The patient has prior failure to Anti-TNF agents (tofacitinib). The patient's age is 36 and there is no information about pregnancy, pouchitis, or extraintestinal manifestations.

Given this context, the top two choices of biological drugs for this patient could be:

1. Upadacitinib
2. Infliximab

Upadacitinib:
- Advantages: Upadacitinib has been shown to have the highest efficacy rates for moderate to severe UC based on ITT analyses. It has been ranked first in terms of clinical remission and clinical response in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies. It also has lower odds of discontinuation due to adverse events during induction.
- Disadvantages: There is no specific disadvantage mentioned in the context for Upadacitinib. However, like all medications, it may have potential side effects that need to be monitored.

Infliximab:
- Advantages: Infliximab has been ranked first in terms of endoscopic improvement. It has also been shown to have a strong effect size for induction of clinical remission in biologic-naïve patients.
- Disadvantages: The patient has lost response to tofacitinib, which is an anti-TNF agent. Infliximab is also an anti-TNF agent, so there may be a risk that the patient may not respond to this treatment as well.

Please note that the final decision should be made in consultation with the patient's healthcare provider, taking into account the patient's overall health, lifestyle, and preferences.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo.","title:

text: discontinuation due to AEs, and serious infections. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials were identified via systematic literature review, in-
cluding the following advanced therapies: infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, golimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab, filgotinib, ozanimod, and 
upadacitinib. Random effects models were used to address between-study heterogeneity. Intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy rates were calculated by 
adjusting maintenance outcomes by likelihood of induction response.
Results:  Out of 48 trials identified, 23 were included. Across all outcomes and regardless of prior biologic exposure, ITT efficacy rates were 
highest for upadacitinib, owing to its highest ranking for all efficacy outcomes in induction and for all but clinical remission during maintenance 
among bio-naive induction responders. For all advanced therapies versus placebo, there were no significant differences in serious AEs or 
serious infections across therapies. For all AEs, golimumab had higher odds versus placebo during maintenance; for discontinuation due to 
AEs, upadacitinib had lower odds versus placebo during induction, while ustekinumab and vedolizumab had lower odds versus placebo during 
maintenance.
Conclusions:  Upadacitinib may be the most efficacious therapy for moderately to severely active UC based on ITT analyses, with similar safety 
across advanced therapies.
Lay Summary 
Indirect evidence suggests upadacitinib may be more efficacious than other advanced therapies at achieving clinical response, clinical remis-
sion, and endoscopic response over 1 year for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients, with similar safety assessments across 
advanced therapies.

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib"

Human: PATIENT PROFILE: question","Based on the patient's profile, the patient is a new patient with moderate to severe extensive ulcerative colitis and extraintestinal manifestation (pyoderma gangrenosum). The patient's age is 18 years old. There is no information about prior response to Infliximab, prior failure to Anti-TNF agents, prior failure to Vedolizumab, pregnancy, or pouchitis.

Given this information, the top two choices of biological drugs would be Infliximab and Adalimumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-α inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It can also be effective in treating extraintestinal manifestations like pyoderma gangrenosum.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab may not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use. It is administered either intravenously which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Adalimumab:
   - Advantages: Adalimumab is another TNF-α inhibitor that can be used in the treatment of moderate to severe UC. It is administered subcutaneously, which some patients may find more convenient than intravenous administration.
   - Disadvantages: Like Infliximab, Adalimumab may not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use. 

Please note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential side effects of the drugs. Regular follow-ups should be scheduled to monitor the patient's response to the treatment.",,,,,,,"title: Efficacy of biological therapies and small molecules in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: systematic review and network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressant, meaning it specifically targets the gut and has less systemic side effects. It has shown efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It is also less likely to cause optic neuritis, a condition that the patient already has.
   - Disadvantages: Vedolizumab is administered intravenously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. It may also not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use.

2. Ustekinumab:
   - Advantages: Ustekinumab is another option for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It targets a different pathway (interleukin-12 and -23) than TNF-α inhibitors, providing an alternative mechanism of action. It is also less likely to cause optic neuritis.
   - Disadvantages: Ustekinumab may not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use. It is also administered subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo."

Human: PATIENT PROFILE: question","Based on the patient's profile, the top two choices of biological drugs for treatment would be Infliximab and Vedolizumab.

1. Infliximab:
   - Advantages: Infliximab is a TNF-α inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for moderate to severe UC. It can help reduce inflammation and achieve remission.
   - Disadvantages: Infliximab may not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use. It is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients.

2. Vedolizumab:
   - Advantages: Vedolizumab is a newer biological therapy that targets α or β integrins, which are involved in the migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa. It can be an effective treatment for patients who have not responded to other treatments.
   - Disadvantages: As with Infliximab, Vedolizumab may not work in all patients and there may be risks associated with its use. It is also administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, which may be inconvenient for some patients. 

It's important to note that the choice of treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition, preferences, and potential for side effects.

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: First- and Second-Line Pharmacotherapies for Patients With Moderate to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis: An Updated Network Meta-Analysis

after diagnosis.9 In a study of 983 patients with CD in Asia,
stricturing or penetrating CD occurred in 41% and perianal
disease in 25% of patients.10 At the other end of the spec-
trum, incidental terminal ileitis can be diagnosed in 1.6% of
individuals undergoing nondiagnostic colonoscopy, with an
uncertain but likely low rate of progression to overt CD.11
With respect to UC, most patients have mild to moderate
severity and 10%–15% of patients can experience a severe
course.12 In a population-based cohort study, proctosigmoid
location of colitis occurred in 73% of patients; of these,
disease extension occurred in 23% of patients at 7 years of
follow-up and it was a marker of worse prognosis.13 The
risk of surgery for CD and UC can be up to 46.6% and 15.6%
10 years after diagnosis, respectively, and has decreased
signiﬁcantly during the last 6 decades.14

include loss of colonic and anorectal function, surgery, and

measured using validated tools, such as the Lemann Index.19
Limited Correlations Among Inﬂammation,
Symptoms, and Complications
The concordance between intestinal inﬂammation and
symptoms can be limited, especially in CD.20,21 In a
population-based cohort, more than 20% of CD patients
were found to have strictures and penetrating disease at the
time of diagnosis, suggesting that clinically silent inﬂam-

text: Disease Phenotype and Clinical Characteristics
The International Organization for the Study of Inﬂam-
matory Bowel Disease and the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) provide a framework for categorization of
CD and UC severity into mild-, moderate-, and high-risk
groups based on phenotype and other characteristics.59,60
In CD, the presence of large or deep mucosal lesions on
endoscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), history of
a ﬁstula, abscess, or intestinal resection are predictors of
worse outcomes.59,60 In a prospective population-based
inception cohort of 213 patients with CD, penetrating
behavior was associated with a higher risk of progression to
perianal disease (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 2.65–12.03) and was a
risk factor for resection (HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.86–8.67) and
hospitalization (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01).16 Ileal and
upper gastrointestinal disease location and extensive dis-
ease are also markers of severe disease.61 Cigarette smoking
is associated with complications and need for therapy
escalation.61
In CD, the threshold of suspicion should be low for high-
quality imaging of the pelvis, such as MRI, to rule our
perianal CD. In a retrospective study of 136 pediatric CD
patients, presence of anal ﬁssures and skin tags, non-White
race, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were risk factors
for perianal CD.62 In another study of 274 patients in China
with recently diagnosed CD, all of whom underwent MRI
pelvis, asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas were diagnosed in
17.5% of patients and colonic location of CD was a risk
factor for asymptomatic perianal ﬁstulas.63
In UC, corresponding predictors of aggressive disease
advised by the International Organization for the Study of
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease include active colonic ulcers
and prior use of biologics.59 Extensive colitis, deep ulcers,
need for corticosteroids, hospitalization, Clostridium difﬁcile,
and cytomegalovirus infection also indicate higher colec-
tomy risk.64 Of note, disease extension from limited disease
to
extensive
or
pancolitis
is
associated
with
worse
prognosis.45,65
In addition, co-occurrence of other immune-mediated
inﬂammatory diseases can occur, most commonly with
psoriasis and asthma, but also, in more rare instances, with
other gastrointestinal diseases (eg, celiac, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease,66 and eosinophilic esophagitis).67,68 Presence
of a concomitant immune-mediated inﬂammatory disease is

STUDY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
What is already known about this subject 
• Ulcerative colitis (UC) follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent 
flares of disease activity, some of which may be moderate to severe. 
• These are usually treated with corticosteroids, which have potentially serious adverse 
effects, so biological therapies and small molecules have been developed and licensed 
for this indication.  
• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have 
shown efficacy in phase III clinical trials that were not considered in these. 
 
What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

BACKGROUND & AIMS:
We compared the efﬁcacy and safety of different ﬁrst-line (biologic-naïve) and second-line
(prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists) agents for treatment of moder-
ate to severely active ulcerative colitis in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS:
We searched publication databases through September 30, 2019, for randomized trials of
adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with TNF antagonists, vedolizumab,
tofacitinib, or ustekinumab, as ﬁrst-line or second-line agents, compared with placebo or
another active agent. Efﬁcacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission and
endoscopic improvement; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. We
performed a ﬁxed-effects network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach, and calculated
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI values. Agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Overall quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
RESULTS:
In biologic-naïve patients, inﬂiximab was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR
vs placebo, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.67–6.21; SUCRA, 0.95) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA, 0.95)
(moderate conﬁdence in estimates [CE]). In patients with prior exposure to TNF antagonists,
ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.87) and tofacitinib (SUCRA, 0.87) were ranked highest for induction of
clinical remission and were superior to vedolizumab (ustekinumab vs vedolizumab: OR, 5.99;
95% CI, 1.13–31.76 and tofacitinib vs vedolizumab: OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.003–8.00; moderate CE)
and adalimumab (ustekinumab vs adalimumab: OR, 10.71; 95% CI, 2.01–57.20 and tofacitinib"

INTRODUCTION 
  Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel that causes 
continuous mucosal inflammation commencing in the rectum and extending proximally for a 
variable extent.[1] It is estimated that UC affects 2.5 million people in Europe,[2] and the 
disease follows a relapsing and remitting course, with intermittent flares of disease activity, 
some of which may be moderate to severe. Management of these is medical, for the most 
part, with surgery reserved for patients with refractory disease. Although 5-aminosalicylates 
(5-ASAs) are efficacious for mild to moderate disease activity,[3-6] more severe flares are 
usually treated with corticosteroids.[7] However, these have potentially serious adverse 
effects and a substantial proportion of patients may become either dependent on them to 
maintain remission,[8] or refractory to them.[9] As a result, over the last 20 years novel 
drugs, with more precise modes of action, based on mechanisms of disease identified in 
genome wide association studies,[10] have been developed.  
The first of these agents was infliximab, a drug targeting the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials in 
moderate to severe UC.[11] Since then, other drugs against TNF-α have been tested, such as 
adalimumab and golimumab.[12, 13] In addition, newer biological therapies targeting α or β 
integrins, which are involved in migration of immune cells to inflamed intestinal mucosa, 
such as vedolizumab or etrolizumab,[14, 15] or acting against other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of UC, such as ustekinumab,[16] have been tested. 
However, even these more selective drugs do not work in all patients, there may be risks 
associated with their use,[17-19] and the fact that they are administered either intravenously 
or subcutaneously, may be inconvenient for patients. The search for alternative agents for the 
treatment of UC has, therefore, continued.","title: Efficacy and safety of biologics and small molecule drugs for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

• Although previous network meta-analyses have compared their efficacy and safety, 
this is a rapidly moving field, and there are already several newer drugs that have

What are the new findings 
• In terms of clinical remission and clinical response, upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked 
first in all patients, in patients previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α therapies, and in patients naïve to these drugs.  
• In terms of endoscopic improvement infliximab 10mg/kg ranked first, followed by 
upadacitinib 45mg o.d., and infliximab 5mg/kg.  
• However, for endoscopic improvement again upadacitinib 45mg o.d. ranked first in 
patients previously exposed to anti-TNF-α therapies, and in patients who were anti-
TNF-α naïve.  
• None of the drugs studied were more likely to lead to serious adverse events than 
placebo."
